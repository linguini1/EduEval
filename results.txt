Amazing prof, shows true passion while teaching. This professor responds to emails in 2-3m most days no joke. Excellent Professor, his live lectures were all great. All of his lectures are fascinating and will go over things you missed if you ask. His lectures are really informative and have a great amount of depth. Honestly the best prof I have ever encountered. He is just a great guy, helped me with school and non-school related subjects. Really wants you to understand the material and gives you everything needed to do so. One of the most caring professors you will ever meet. He taught the course really well given the circumstances. Many students from non-computer majors come in and watch his lectures. Excellent Professor that puts genuine effort into his lectures. Very generous with midterm marking and wants everyone to do well. As long as you attend the lectures and take some time to understand the material Gohary is one of the best professors you can take.
Negative Feedback: 
If anyone says this professor is bad they are simply lying because they did not put the effort needed to pass the course. The midterm and exams are hard, but he truly does want every student to pass

Explains everything about the course, you could probably understand it straight out of highschool. Do all the homeworks without procrastinating, and you'll do great. Gives great lectures and is always happy to help in office hours. which keeps you up to date throughout the semester. Exam was fair, test and labs were marked easily and there were bonus marks on the midterm. He will take the time to clarify in the lecture or during office hours and makes sure you understand. If you can do the few problems in the book, you will do great on his quizs or exams

Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there. Learning C isn't easy for most, and she does make the effort to ensure people mostly understand the concepts. Martin is much better in person, although she has little control over the exams, she delivers course content in the most digestible manner possible. Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well.

ECOR1606: 
Postive Feedback: 
She genuinely wants her students to do well. Ecor1041-1042 She is a nice professor and has good structure in her lectures. The lecture is so-so, actually not that effective. Definitely recommend to practice and study on your own. She has the most monotone voice I have ever heard. The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track. If you attend ALL her classes, its an easy A+. If you took even one high school programming class, you should be good for ECOR 1606. and yeah she is a great swimmer, swimming coach and world record holder. Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor).
Negative Feedback: 
I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material. Assigments are hard a bit .Final exam was extremly hard . She is not that bad with teaching but she is very very very tough with marking and creating questions for tests and finals. She is rude and makes you not want to ask her anything ever again.

COMP3005: 
Postive Feedback: 
I don't understand why many students are rating the professor low. He seems like he'd be a really nice person in real life because he gives extensions whenever we ask for them... This professor absolutely does not care about the class he is teaching at all. He is absolutely 0 at teaching, hopefully he is ok at research otherwise why Carleton hired him. Doesn't answer questions usefully in class or anywhere else - if you don't get something, you're on your own. Get ready to remember who won the Turing award. He reads off of slides that are usually filled with mistakes that he doesn't fix until after he notices or someone points it out during a lecture. The moment I looked at his slides and saw there were more than 60 pages, I gave up on actually attending lectures. Creates lectures the day of and are riddeled with many errors, fixing them in the middle of a lecture. Amazing how he can put together so many slides and have no absorb-able information. Don't bother going to lectures because you will learn absolutely nothing. Do yourself a favour and drop any courses you've got with him, right now. A prof interesting on researching, not good at teaching, spent me a lots time self studying....read the book plz, then u get A, if any questions, ask him, he is nice to answer Qs, even tell u more. Spend most of your time doing assignments and reviewing his lecture notes.
Negative Feedback: 
Extremely poorly worded assignments (cost me 10% of my final grade). Extremely disappointed in this professor and really regret taking this course with him. His lectures are a mess, he's hard to understand and is not at all helpful when asked for help. The material wasn't difficult but the exam was. There are no good things that can be said about Mengchi. This is the absolute worst prof I've ever had. His wording can be extremely confusing and even self-contradictory. i had Prof Mengchi for comp 3005 and hes absoultely the worst professor i have ever encountered. Tons of typos and terrible Engrish on his slides. The class itself is actually not bad, but the way he teaches it is brutal. Terrible slides with tons of syntax/grammar/spelling errors which he doesnt bother fixing. Agree with the other reviews, at least for COMP3005. Seriously, this guy is the most boring teacher I've ever had. Uses text files to present the material, explains them horribly. Reads straight from slides, badly maintained website, hard to follow in class, poor assignment timing... This guy is out right the worst prof i have had in my university career (6 years). He talks very quite and the lectures are boring

You will get a good mark if you put in the work. The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor. Amazing professor, studies in addictions was my favourite class and he was the one of the best prof's I had. Genuinely cares about his students success. If you are ever struggling with anything, go see him in office hours, he is SO helpful, clear and supportive of your ideas and writing. The course material is interesting but for the most part everything is made far more complicated than needed

Negative Feedback: 
Can't put into words how horrible this class was taught. I never say anything negative about profs but this guy was by far without a doubt the WORST professor I have ever had in my multiple years of school. I've attended 3 different schools and have never come across a professor that was so disorganized, not understanding, rude, and just plain and simple awful. He doesn't care, won't be at his office hours, won't talk to you outside of class and then gets mad at you for asking questions in class.

Really great professor, very clear when explaining concepts, always tried to answer any questions we had. Absolutely the best prof I've ever had at U of T. His pre-class videos and super helpful, he's always willing to meet with students outside of class for further clarification on the material, and he explains concepts in an easy to understand way.

STA302: 
Postive Feedback: 
Katherine was a fair instructor, organized, clear lectures & provided leniency with 2 no-questions asked extensions for students. She is easily offended, and questions are taken as criticism taking up a defensive tone as though we're attacking her character. Katherine is an okay lecturer, she explains the concepts clearly. She will torture you when you take the course, but she also will give you a huge curve when you done the course. The grading in this course are very inconsistent. The time commitment required to marginally do good in this course is extremely high. While prof tries to be nice, way too high requirements. Sooooooo many assignments and tests and projects. She packs the lectures with way too much content and gives way too much work. Great lectures and she provides neat notes. I really like her, I took her STA257 as well. The learninng experience with her in STA302 is amazing, she lay emphasis on how to use your knowledge and do analysis instead of just do the questions. And she responds emails and piazza detailed
Negative Feedback: 
Midterm exam was difficult, so prepare well. worst prof ever seen, donnnnnnnnnn't choose this ***. The most awful professor I have ever seen. Lectures are completely useless, she just reads off her slides. Quizzes are insanely hard and lectures do not help at all. Grading was late making impossible to drop course or CR/NCR before deadline. Worst prof in my entire undergrad, has no respect or empathy and gives 0 f about students and accommodating accessibilities. Horrible human being, I thought I knew what I was going into taking a course with her but holy I was so wrong. I had to create an account on this website just to express how bad of a prof she is. The questions are just completely unrelated to the stuff she covered in lectures and everything u reviewed is just useless.

STA257: 
Postive Feedback: 
This course really require a lot of efforts. Her lectures are pretty detailed and very helpful for quizzes and exams. I really enjoy learning new statistics knowledges in her class. On many occasions she'd repeat herself without realizing it. She teaches fairly decent but the logistics and outside of class aspect is what weight the most. leading to most of us having panic attacks on the way out. First of all this was not very mathematically rigorously taught, more like we had to develop the intuition and learn the material on our own as the lectures were just a carbon copy of the textbook. Lectures consisted of her reading off her slides which were primarily copy pasted from the textbook. Good job reading from slides without explanation. She really messed up this attracting course. The later section can easily get the answer from the former one and have 2 more days for preparing
Negative Feedback: 
She is a ppt reader, totally waste of time to attend her lecture. Always made mistakes in quizzes, quite rude to students. Taking this course is the worst experience in uni and I received the worst grade that I have ever got with no surprise. ( The participation requirement is a bit annoying, especially for people living in other time zone like me. There is heavy pre lecture prep and needless synchronous lectures with little value to add to the independent prep. I got an A, but she is the worst prof I have ever had. I knew im going to fail the minute i see the question. Choose Katherine if you want fail this course. The worst prof I have seen at UofT, or I should not say she is a prof or a teacher. I probably gonna fail STA257, she is rediculous. I dont know how she manages to copy and paste the textbook and do it wrong every week. Definitely the worst professor I've ever met in uoft. I haven't ever found statistics that hard. Even though her slides are not too bad, there are countless typos and she cannot even fix her mistakes during the lecture. Lecture is a waste of time and test questions are unfair.

BCH210: 
Postive Feedback: 
She is incredibly unapproachable and uncaring. I really hope someone else teaches the BCH210 class. As the person responsible for all our tests, yikes. As a lecturer and course coordinator, I've actually found that she's really nice and accessible in person. Patterson is a good lecturer I learned a lot about biochemistry. She needs help cause she really thought we were phd level students. Even if you know the materials inside out, she makes sure to pull the weirdest questions. The slides are not as detailed as lectures. Every word and every sentence on her slides are testable, so make sure you fully understand them. However, as long as you prepare well, it's very possible to get good marks on her tests. Professor Patterson is a very good lecturer and easy to follow, organized, and I actually really enjoyed the material. Patterson is a good lecturer; her slides are easy to understand and she explains concepts quite well. i think that dr patterson is able to explain the content well and i do leave the lectures with a pretty solid understanding of the material but testing is just not reflective of what is taught. sometimes better at explaining concepts in office hours. MC questions ask you which is most important for metabolism, you can provide an argument for all the answers, but the correct one is what she thinks it is. Metabolism in Motion: Engaging Biochemistry Students with Animation". Publishing paper like this does not make you a better professor, Patterson. I've got 4 textbooks, and I still can't do good in her class. For the students that gave her a good rating. She doesn't answer questions in any sort of useful or helpful way, and goes through lectures too quickly. You come into u of t fresh faced and optimistic. Professor Patterson is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Tests the most obscure details while never focuses on them in lectures. She is so kind, she shelters the blame for an average of 52%. Patterson does absolutely nothing to help you learn. I am sitting in her class rating her, I'd rather read the textbooks I bought but since I paid for tuition its better to sit here even I do nothing. Don't know which the important to remember. It is very quick explaining in the end of the course, I cannot follow very well. Prof Patterson has been an amazing professor throughout the term and made biochemistry actually quite fun. Patterson is tough, but her class is very fair. people come to university to get a good education not to get easy work. In order to get an A, focus more on the learning objectives and actually participate in tutorials. Her lectures were fine... The assignments are super long, and mostly unrelated to anything we learn about in class. It's quite surprising to see how high her rating is. I get that we, as university students, are responsible for learning the materials. It feels like I learn more from Google than her. That's about 10 hours for the whole summer semester. Lectures are short and not too detailed but the quizzes are soooo detailed. But i found that the material itself is actually very interesting. Her slides are organized and easy to follow. She was clear, concise and organized, and her test questions were extremely fair. Her section is the hardest, but most interesting and rewarding section of BCH210. Goes through material really fast, doesn't reply to emails. Amazing Prof. It was really fair if not easy in my opinion. She writes the kind of final you need two weeks to study for. Test was super fair and she made a lot of material seem like a breeze.
Negative Feedback: 
Absolutely terrible course... the content was doable and its biochem so obviously its tuff but she made it IMPOSSIBLE. I want to confront her and tell her she made my dislike myself over a STUPID COURSE. On tests, there are trick questions that require you to carefully read every word of the question because it is trying to lead you to the wrong answer. this course is not easy, but majority of us required it and had no choice. BCH with Patterson is the worst course I have ever taken. Assignment and her teaching sucks, course can be self taught. That being said, her tests can be BRUTAL. by far the worst professor and course I have been forced to endure during my time at uoft. Somehow finds a way to make mc tests excruciatingly difficult and hyperspecific on very peripheral information. The tests and quizzes are unnecessarily difficult. Content isn't that hard but the way the questions are worded results in poor grades. Studied a week for the midterms and the results were still horrible. Really the worst professor I've had at this school. Her aim is simple: YOU SHOULD ALL FAIL IN BIOCHEMISTRY, period. Awful term test with a 59% average INCLUDING 2 bonus marks. Coming to Con Hall at 10 am 3x a week is miserable enough. She makes every topic very confusing and cannot manage her time efficiently. Awful PowerPoints, not helpful at all, not well-organized and makes you confused. so so unfair that awful professors are allowed to continue teaching required courses for so many majors and get paid so much. Makes you feel bad for getting low quiz marks as if we all have a phd in biochemistry. Course turned into 3 tumbling research assignments and annoying weekly quizzes. She is hard marker and wants students to do poorly, she also has a bad attitude towards students when students approach for help. Aher exams are brutal and unfair with 0 curves, tries very hard to screw your mark in the course. Never ask any questions cuz she uses passive aggresive tone with a disgusted expression on her face. She only reads slides in class and gives brutal exams. Lectures were fine, just a bit boring and confusing. The poor TA had to teach us everything during a 2 hour weekly tutorial. when emailing her, she can be very rude and dismissive. Very hard to follow along in her lectures. Unspeakably poor delivery methods, shameless lack of awareness on her part. She's clearly reading off a script, making efficient, active-recall type notes impossible. Quizzes are terrible 15 minute 10 questions, lectures are pretty useless. She much more horrible than anything else except the COVID19. Whatever small detail she says in the lecture, guarantee you it will be on the quiz. The writing assignments were absolutely heavy and unpleasant. Her lectures seem simple but her test questions and assignments are insane. One of the worst professors I've had at UofT. Her quizzes are difficult, and contain material that was discussed for less than a minute during lectures. She isn't a bad prof but her tests are extremely difficult. Was scared to take a course with her because of the horrible reviews.

Do the wiley plus questions as well -- those are great practice. The lectures are engaging and the prof is nice. Prof Mike does not do much himself except lecture. He made the course challenging when it really shouldn't have been. He sells you his own textbook and teaches only from his life. Hes a fraud who sells his own textbook to students. However, it's certainly important to listen to every word he said during the class, especially the guest lecture. Prof Khan is one of the best profs you will have in Rotman first year. Midterms and finals are easy and short if you study correctly. Everything in lectures are testable which makes it easy to study. ( He is kind and it is your first opportunity in Rotman Commerce to network with a valuable person. Study for the tests and try to get a good mark on the group project. The exam tested mostly on lecture content, rewatch the recordings, draw a mind map and write out possible quest if have time. Definitely not my favourite prof but I surely learned a lot from him. He made a really good effort to adjust to online learning. And he made lectures more interesting with his case studies. I got a 64% the first time and had to redo the course. Overall, a really nice and funny guy... likes talking about himself but he keeps lectures fun and engaging. Gives you a good overview of business also catches you up on current events. He marks his short answer very specifically so make sure you write word for word what he says in lectures. He's a pretty inconsiderate guy and will tell you to retake the course if you don't like your grade. Spends class time talking about himself/his own accomplishments. Khan is an enthusiastic professors and lectures are engaging. He's funny and tries to make lectures interesting. The wiley quiz answers are on quizlet, but for the midterm and final you need to memorize and be able to explain concepts. Professor Khan was much better than Oesch. He was engaging, provided valuable examples, and made it clear as to what was being tested. Professor Khan is a great lecturer and encourages class discussion. He is very kind to students especially if you go to his classes so he knows ur face. I just toke RSM100 and Khan is a great professor!. Great professor, don't understand how anyone could not like him. He is pretty arrogant and loves to talk about himself, though. He is not a  "level 5 leader", as he does not seem to take review criticism very well. He enjoys himself more than 90% of his students. Gosh...who will pay attention for almost full year course and remember everything from his talking. He is an amiable man who enjoys his own classes ore than the students do
Negative Feedback: 
But his tests are very heavily based on memorization and not having knowledge on the course. One question asked the guest lecturer's companies name which seemed pointless. No one can understand what he says He gives a very difficult midterm and final with (30-50%) avg range with no bell curve at all in order to lower the averages... Textbook heavy, remember the vocab and italic ones. You need to write the key words down, word for word, or else it's wrong. Michael Khan is the stereotypical business person. The readings are so time consuming and useless, and the lectures are so boring but you MUST TAKE GOOD NOTES!. I did rlly bad on midterm cuz note taking things that he wasnt gonna post later was hard. His lectures are boring, he is full of himself and  he does not really teach anything of substance. His lectures are mostly pointless (but he puts 50% of lecture stuffs on the final exam..) So basically, he forces his students to attend his boring lectures.

I know I myself and even some straight A friends have gotten our GPAs nuked by this course. She is knowledgeable, caring, and responds quickly to emails. I enjoyed her lectures and she gave just the right amount of information to understand the relevance of the topic and to solve problems related to the material. I wouldn't have taken courses with her if I didn't absolutely had too. She gives an amazing introduction, amazing background knowledge, but the material which she will test you on, she just skims through it. I enjoyed the lectures by Prof. P and she's always available to answer questions. Although the course has a pretty heavy workload, I enjoyed her lectures, her test was fair, and her instructions are clear. P puts alot of effort into the course, and she is always available to answer questions. P is one of the best profs that I have had so far. She's super caring as a person (from my interactions) and she means well. She was always very helpful and I thought her lectures were easy to follow. P is a very approachable professor who is always very helpful. She is very approachable and kind, and will help with any question you may have (genetics or not!).

she teaches the most useless class of your degree but makes it seem like the most important. Course material is very light though, don't buy the textbook: everything is online. Many people don't buy her book and pass her class. Inspiring, wants her students to succeed, clear expectations of her students, great feedback on assignments and exams. Also her book of laws is great and worth the 100$. Firstly, we HAVE to buy a $100 textbook which she literally copied from the Government of Ontario's documents available in public domain. Doesn't matter if you hand in the best work or literally a blank paper - you will get a straight 75. She focuses more on her narcissistic accomplishments than actually teaching the class. Youre literally better off learning the course yourself, because she actually confuses you by teaching. Puts students on the spot with questions in front of the whole class.
Negative Feedback: 
We had a few study sessions at her house. I am shocked how she can do literally no work and not be terminated 5 years ago. One of the worst, rudest prof that you can't skip in uOttawa. She is the worst professor the University of Ottawa has ever hired. Terrible grader, will refuse to talk to you over email, and has no issue with insulting you straight to your face. She strives to make student's lives miserable. She makes you buy her textbook which is useless since you can find everything online. Lectures were not organized well and she is very rude towards her student. When I first read the reviews, I didn't think that she'd be this bad but after taking this class with her, I now know why people hate her so much. Dont bother speaking because youre wrong, and I hope youre bilingual because her PowerPoints are.

ECO1102: 
Postive Feedback: 
He doesn't help his students and doesn't convey material in a logical and simplified form. probably my heaviest class but one of my better marks. ECO1104 and ECO112 are both relatively straightforward courses. Makes his expectations very clear, and all assignments/exams are fair and manageable if you keep up with the course material. Surprised if anyone got a good mark on them. I have another class with him and am genuinely looking forward to it. Midterms were easy though, all multiple choice. He refuses to post his lecture notes and goes through the slides so quickly. The exam takes a lot of application so you need to really understand. If you aren't a math person get ready to WORK girl. Don't bother going to class, everything is on bright space and in the textbook. Good lectures, but not an easy grade, you have to work for it and practise. Lectures are dry but useful if you want a good grade in the class. If you just show up and listen rather than watching a movie on your laptop, youll be fine. People are probably bias because they want this class to be easy A. His notes are thorough and lectures very intense and informative. Aplia assignments were fine and were free marks. I had him for 1102, he's very well spoken and will respond to emails. One class might be good, the next your board and waiting for it to end. The concepts aren't easy but if you attend lectures and follow his notes you can do well. He is very fair and let's you know what is important to study. Very approachable during office hours and gave good advice and answers to all my questions. Lenjosek's most redeeming quality is his clarity and his lecture notes. love his lecture notes when I overselpt the morning classes.

The workload wasn't crazy but the mid-terms were awful. the worst and rudest professor at uOttawa. Tests are difficult, lectures are boring and his attitude is horrendous. Seems like his life is unhappy and he takes it out on his students. He comes off as rude sometimes and when asked a question he sometimes doesnt answer. The practice midterms are so useless - in summary: just dont take him.

Is very opinionated and brings up unrelated things during lectures. His slide notes are great and you don't need to use the textbook. The Aplia is a perfect way to gain added marks. He is always available to  answer questions and respond to emails quickly.

I'm not saying they were just hard, of course i've learned stuff that was much harder than economics but he made it way harder and boring

Amazing prof if you are just getting started in programming. You can tell she hopes for her students' success while also being realistic about their success. the class is okay for people who already know how to code but if you don't definitely learn in advance and do some projects. If you cheat, you will get caught for sure. If you come into the class with any programming experience, its an easy A. With that being said Vida is a great prof who cares greatly for both the subject and students. Her lectures are clear and have great explanations with enough examples to get you started. She cannot spell correctly in her own tests and she cannot describe clearly what she wants. Her tests were designed for longer than was given (I need more time to come up with solutions for coding questions). Having Professor Vida Dujmovic as one of my first professors at UOttawa was a blessing. This was my favorite class first semester. Prof Vida conveys the material very clearly and provides many examples throughout lectures, which are posted within 24hrs. The textbook is provided, I did not use it very often. She was very organized and her forums in the coursepage was very helpful. Aziz's class, as well as myself, an ITI1520 student, watch her lectures because she is simply BETTER in EVERY ASPECT. She teaches the material perfectly and doesn't overcomplicate anything. She's really nice and easy to follow during lectures, however there's a massive disparity in difficulty between the content she covers during class and the things you have to do for her assignments. Easily accessible and prompt&effective feedback after class. Although the assignments are a bit load but really helpful and practical. - Vida is one of the most organized profs I've ever seen. Very responsible prof who records all lectures online. All the lectures were recorded and the code from them was available as well which made studying a lot easier. Shes a very good professor and is very smart, but she is very mean, condisending, and has no patience for students who are not doing well. She was happy to see her student progress. Great first class and introduction to computer science using python. I would recommend taking your first year course with her. If you already know programming it is an easy A.   I liked the multiple choice exams. i love that she records lectures and codes along with us in class. you can also tell that shes funny and genuinely nice person. All of her lectures are recorded and she goes through everything step by step in front of you so it's easy to follow. Assignments are easy if you listen to all her lectures. All assignments are very clearly indicated, and she is quick to reply to any ambiguity via the online forum
Negative Feedback: 
Assignments are slightly difficult and sometimes time consuming but the tests are on the easier side. Heavy course load and have to put effort into it. Her assignments seemed hard but were not that hard. The midterm and final are difficult to study for since they don't give review for either. Her lectures, although I found them quite boring, were very informative and were key to understanding Python. I had very little programming experience, but I still got over 80%. This is a heavy workload class but if you put in the work, you'll get the A. however, i HATE her evaluations. this course can be hard if you do not have previous programming experience.

Taking prof Mulveys class is a pure enjoyment because he is such a good storyteller. It is undeniable that the prof is a humorous and cool guy, but the lectures are oversimplified and abstract. I have a higher year course, which is asking, read an article and respond in 2-3 pg 2x spaced, for 15%. Hilarious guy, but not a good teacher; spends more time goofing off and talking about his life growing up than explaining course materials. Has weekly "dojo challenges" that start the first week; even though the deadline to switch into class is 3 weeks after; he won't allow you to make up for the ones missed if you switched. Really great prof with a fun and innovative teaching style. Course content is interesting and relatable and he's a fun guy to talk to. Prof Mulvey is amazing during the pandemic, he's easily best streamer I had since the start of online class. Nice professors always available for student. Lectures are not only inspirational, but also extremely memorable. His lectures are so engaging you forget you're at school. One of my greatest experiences at university thus far. Amazing professor, one of the best professors at Telfer. Knows how to keep your attention and makes class interesting. Loves to teach, he's funny, and gives good explanations. The course is very challenging, and to do well, you must read your textbook thoroughly and attend lectures. Great prof and very passionate/enthusiastic about his subject. Sincerely wants to help you with your future and is always available for questions. Mulvey teachs his stuff in such an interesting way that you even don't want to skip any class. Absolutely the best teacher I have had at UofO. He puts so much time and effort into his presentations. This is by far the best reacher i've had in university. This si the first class that i've actually done more work than required because it is so interesting

Professor Mulvey is definitely the best marketing prof at Telfer. Great Prof, Down to Earth, overall excellent experience taking his class; Cream of the crop when it comes to University profs.. You HAVE to go to class if you want to really benefit from the Mulvey experience. He's a great professor, funny and enjoyable. He shows a lot of ad clips/video clips to convey the subject matter (very interesting). I would recommend him to anyone interested in Marketing.

Professor Quadir consistently goes the extra mile for students in his great preparation of materials and examples. Professor Tanvir really tries to make sure students do well in his class. He also was always accessible via email, after class and office hours for questions. 4/6 Mc quizzes 5Q each are an easy 10% if you attend class. Midterm and Exam were very fair questions. His assignment guidelines were especially useful, as they walked you through what was expected for each question

Go to class/watch the lectures, do the homework, and textbook learning checks, they cover exactly what you need to know. I never asked him questions in class, but he was always willing to answer questions during the 10 minute break in class. Super helpful prof, many evaluations and resources so you can practice. Professor Quadir is one of the best professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students and wants us to succeed. He wants to make sure we understand and do well which is very much appreciated. He has lots of experience with research, so lots of great examples

PHI2396: 
Postive Feedback: 
He just rambles on for the whole class and leaves it to the students to have an open discussion, which I suppose makes sense for a philosophy teacher, but most of the people who take this class are enrolled in a science program, so this kind of format is unfamiliar. This class certainly had the potential to be interesting, but it was not. His midterm had so many questions on it that were not covered. Honestly, he has a good heart, but the way he taught in this pandemic was not for me. Made zoom classes interesting and he showed us his chickens. This guy's so funny and probably the realest prof I've ever had. He's really good at leading discussions and gets you to think critically about ethical issues. Made the course so much easier than it would've been.

McKenna is by far and away the worst prof I've had so far. The midterm was extremely hard and did not care. The grading is extremely harsh on papers and doesn't even make sense. His multiple choice exams were unnecessarily difficult. The textbook was so poorly written and not relevant to bioethics - it was ridiculous

Although a lot of reading is required, but he will give you the questions before the exams to prepare, so it's pretty fair. He gives questions ahead of time and his exams are pretty fair. It makes perfect sense to stay in a class that one hates. He is a great lecturer and his tests are pretty fair.

You can tell he cares about his class, and he really wants them to learn and be interested. I am NOT a huge fan of philosophy, but it was a mandatory course and it ended up being VERY interesting with his teaching techniques.

All of the poor ratings honestly made me so nervous to take this class but I'm so glad I did. His assignments are marked fairly, I'm in Science and haven't written a paper in my life but got all A's . The material was really interesting, and the prof conveyed the material very well too. Straightforward lectures and responds quickly to emails and accommodation requests. A great professor who is very clearly passionate about what he's teaching.

That being said, it was very difficult to get anything over a B+ in this class. The prof is not too bad, he replies emails and is helpful if you reach out

I thought his labs were really well organized. The class is a lot and very time consuming, BUT you'll get good grades if you're competent since most of the stuff evaluated is pretty easy. Tutorial docs to help with homework and reports were very detailed though. The most homework-heavy course Ive ever taken.
Negative Feedback: 
Doesn't answer questions and is very rude with students. DO NOT take this course unless youre forced to. Work load +++, very tough on exams and goes outside what was covered in labs

Postive Feedback: 
the hw instructions are very unclear so i recommend attending lectures. Does his review course but does not make the presentation of it available. There were many times I was fed up with his attitude and how he deals with things. Never went to his lectures but I was better off. If you have a choice, which I really hope you do, please avoid him. Does not post marks until the very end, which means you have no idea how you are doing in the class. I attended his office hours for questions and feedback, he was very kind, respectful and extremely helpful. The lab manual is filled with spelling errors and mistakes. Honestly, he makes metabolism pretty decent and his tests are fair. Lab component was tough, make sure you get a good partner. However, Luc gave a generous amount of free percent to the final grade, which helped a lot. He gives great feedback and is extremely approachable. Poitras is super helpful if you go to his office and even if he drops by your lab section. He gives great feedback on lab books and formal reports
Negative Feedback: 
the final exam is really difficult so maybe rewatch all the lectures to be prepared. lab manuel and protocols are extremely difficult to follow and poorly written. Watch the lecture before lab if you can, but you won't fail w/o it. almost everything is now application based because its online and Luc is not a nice man. he says things in the beginning of the course that might make you think he is but he comes off as passive aggressive sometimes as if he's being forced to teach. Refuses to regrade assignments when points were taken off unfairly. He's the worst prof I've encountered in all of uni. Gives the absolute worst instructions and everything is so unnecessarily confusing. Manual is long and tedious but it's helpful for studying. Final exam was brutal, heard he curves tho. The worst lab course I have taken so far.

Content was VERY interesting and slideshows were pretty organized. I typed out everything of what he said in class (made a doc over 350 pages) and made my own cheating sheet and got A+ on both midterms. You're given a task--teach hundreds of incredibly smart & motivated students paying thousands to hear you talk. Like what others said- his exams are extremely fair. pretty straightforward and easy to do well if you study his notes and understand the concepts (don't just memorize). The course seemed to get easier after the first midterm (my opinion)
Negative Feedback: 
Like a lot of my student colleagues mentioned, there is no email etiquette, no learning objectives, and vague exams. From PTSD from BCH2333, I took this course very seriously. After 4 years, Luc is easily the worst prof I've had. Makes exams way too long, speeds through 70 slide lectures and spends 10 minutes wasting class time talking about nonsense but blames his students asking questions as the reason to why he's so behind. The material isn't too difficult, everything you need to know is on the slides

Great prof, lectures are just him talking at you, but it's fairly easy to grapple with the subject matter. The assignments are straightforward and relatively easy but you should probably start them a week or two in advance. All seriousness, didn't enjoy class at all. Wolfgang is amazing if you want a 7-10 that lets you out at 8. BEST Prof Ever, super nice, amazing and understandable- sometimes the lectures can end up all over the place, but the means good. Literally the best professor I have ever gotten. Don't wanna skip his classes ever because they are literally the best. Lectures are dry, but he's hilarious and always cracking jokes to liven the mood. There's no blackboard for this course so its most definitely worthwhile to attend lectures, but he is very approachable about the class material. He's so nice and makes sure that all the material is understood. He is the most laid back professor you'll ever get. He just lectures (no powerpoints) which makes him really easy to follow along with. An extremely intelligent man always available for discussion after class. Very easy to reach if you have questions or need help.

Do you like taking massive amounts of notes through hard to follow lectures, just to get handed a midterm with 6 poorly designed questions that can be answered in 2 sentences. What should have been three hour lect never went past 1.5-2h.

His lectures perfectly prepare you for the final exam. Koerner is very accommodating and extremely nice.

He assigns a whole bunch of books and talks about a whole bunch of authors but never says anything about the books he gives us. He's really great at answering questions. It was a 7-10 class and we were out by 8:30pm at the latest. The two short term papers are extremely easy and straight forward. Take notes on everything he says and regurgitate it on the exam and you're golden (I got an A and didn't buy the textbook). Lectures are very detailed and if you take good notes you can write the essays and exam with only a little reading.
