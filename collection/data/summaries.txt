Carleton University: Ariel Fuenzalida, SOCI3055
Negative Summary:
* Assigns an insane amount of reading that is never tested on or discussed in class

Neutral Summary:
* Final paper is a joke 12-14 pages..
* Where do I begin
* Also, the prof who engages students by using videos
* Most of the SOCI students complained about the 3-hour length and weren't very engaged to begin with
* Tells you exactly what you need to have read for the exams, making the rest of your reading completely useless(which is annoying after you've read it all).

Positive Summary:
* You will get a good mark if you put in the work
* The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor
* Amazing professor, studies in addictions was my favourite class and he was the one of the best prof's I had
* He truly wants his students to learn and grow.

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* 

Neutral Summary:
* I took the course as an online offering in 2021
* She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab
* She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms

Positive Summary:
* The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2006
Negative Summary:
* Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews)

Neutral Summary:
* Dr
* Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice
* Dr
* Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr
* She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to
* She always explains questions with care and lots of examples

Positive Summary:
* Learning C isn't easy for most, and she does make the effort to ensure people mostly understand the concepts
* Martin is much better in person, although she has little control over the exams, she delivers course content in the most digestible manner possible
* Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well
* She takes an effort to answer questions and does a lot of examples/visual explanations, which is much needed for a programming class.

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, ECOR1606
Negative Summary:
* I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material
* Assigments are hard a bit .Final exam was extremly hard
* She is rude and makes you not want to ask her anything ever again
* She usually goes over the assignment the lecture after it's assigned

Neutral Summary:
* She can be particular on how things are done and submitted, but is always super clear on what she expects beforehand
* I used to fall asleep every single lecture
* She explains things in a clear way, especially for the students who are complete noobs to coding
* Complete a chapter every 1-2 weeks if you like keeping up with lectures.

Positive Summary:
* She genuinely wants her students to do well
* Definitely recommend to practice and study on your own
* The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track
* Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor).

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2002
Negative Summary:
* she is rude, and show no-patience when u asking question
* I asked her about an assignment I had a small problem with, she told she can't help me, and to debug it
* The most useless, boring and atrociously mean person

Neutral Summary:
* After adjusting to programming lingo and what not, I found her to be very...interesting, in terms of her lectures
* I was just reading the other comments about her, and I'm not alone
* I then went to Bryant and he fixed my program
* She is ok teacher but maybe not a nice person

Positive Summary:
* She is too fast and she is strict in marking
* Some of the stuff at the end (like Linked List and everything it led up to), I found helpful for the classes, although if they are still selling the course notes, than I'd suggest buying those and reading them on your own time which beat attending lectures
* Had her for summer session of ECOR 1606 and I didn't like her much because I felt she taught for those who already had a programming background
* Even in her office, when I found the free time, she was never any help

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* This Professor does an awful job teaching online
* Her lectures are very confusing considering that they are all pre-recorded videos from pervious years

Neutral Summary:
* A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq
* Lots of bonuses in the class (around an extra 7%) which will really help
* Her own version of online course contents crashes at least once a month that too before the assignment submission

Positive Summary:
* There are SO many opportunities for bonus marks it's not even funny
* Every bonus opportunity is also a meaningful example to engage with the course material in a practical way

* Great lectures, fair exams, always available for questions.

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2006

* Prof
* Her lectures are extremely well organized and she goes through many examples to further understanding
* I found the midterm and final to be moderately difficult, but overall fair
* She provides plenty of material, practice and homework on her culearn (I don' think any other prof puts as much effort as her into her culearn).

Positive Summary:
* Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there
* Good prof, the people who don't do well in the class don't do the work
* She wants people to keep on failing and not passing her course

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC3303
Negative Summary:
* That said, she has some pretty annoying teaching problems: she marks by removing marks whenever you do something wrong, which is a problem because she asks vague questions with specific answers in mind.

Neutral Summary:
* That said DO NOT take 3303 with her in the summer, she expect you to do 12 weeks of spread out work in 6 weeks and still marks hard (no clear marking scheme)
* She also writes marathon exams and midterms like go into the exam and try to do as much as possible correctly not finish cause u wont
* She also makes you memorize arbitrary things (e.g
* KNOWS NOTHING
* Likes to give long and hard midterms and even harder finals

Positive Summary:
* Gives great lectures and the notes are good
* She is pretty helpful when you ask her questions
* Very strict marker however..
* Extremely picky at marking - must have perfect syntax

Carleton University: Mengchi Liu, COMP3005
Negative Summary:

* Reads slides like a text-to-speech editor, and is next to impossible to understand
* Words cannot express just how incompetent this man is at teaching
* Reads straight from slides, badly maintained website, hard to follow in class, poor assignment timing..
* This guy is out right the worst prof i have had in my university career (6 years).

Neutral Summary:
* Professor Liu is generous with giving extensions and his assignments are based on his notes
* Single word answers to specific questions asked, barely responds to emails, the midterm was longer than an assignment and we had to wait to begin the midterm so he could "confirm our identity" over BBB (We could leave the call after this...(?))
* The professor..
* He feels like one of those professors that are there for the sake of having a grant and teaching only because he has to
* Requires that TAs follow midterm definitions to a tee; if the student does not include specific words, they will lose marks.

Positive Summary:
* I don't understand why many students are rating the professor low
* He seems like he'd be a really nice person in real life because he gives extensions whenever we ask for them..
* This professor absolutely does not care about the class he is teaching at all
* Do yourself a favour and drop any courses you've got with him, right now
* There isn't much I can say that the others below me haven't, so basically, avoid Liu at all costs.

Carleton University: Michael Runtz, 1902
Negative Summary:

* Should not be online if the professor can not upload videos due to him being remote
* He is lighthearted, but do not take this course unless you are prepared to respect it

Positive Summary:
* Everyone should take 1902 at some point (an easy 90 if you take good notes)

* In his first class, he presumptuously claims that it will change the way you think...and he's right

Carleton University: Paul Mkandawire, HUMR2202
Negative Summary:
* Can't put into words how horrible this class was taught
* I never say anything negative about profs but this guy was by far without a doubt the WORST professor I have ever had in my multiple years of school
* I've attended 3 different schools and have never come across a professor that was so disorganized, not understanding, rude, and just plain and simple awful

Neutral Summary:
* Attendance is required for the class and the tutorials
* I will not take another human rights couse again
* This 2nd yr course is harder than all of my 4th yr courses
* It is clear he has zero care for his students, is unaccessible and at times just rude.

Positive Summary:

* 

Neutral Summary:
* Looks for opportunities to help his students out, not just with their learning but also marks

University Of Toronto: Michael Khan, RSM100
Negative Summary:
* But his tests are very heavily based on memorization and not having knowledge on the course
* No one can understand what he says He gives a very difficult midterm and final with (30-50%) avg range with no bell curve at all in order to lower the averages..
* Textbook heavy, remember the vocab and italic ones
* It can get annoying but at least he isn't boring or anything
* His lectures are mostly pointless (but he puts 50% of lecture stuffs on the final exam..) So basically, he forces his students to attend his boring lectures.

Neutral Summary:
* Course is doable (and aceable) if you attend lectures and write down all key case studies
* Turned an easy, informing course into an unnecessary struggle simply to weed out students in year 1
* Mr
* Khan is the G.O.A.T
