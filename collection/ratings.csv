0,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Amazing prof, shows true passion while teaching. Makes sure everything is understandable. Responds to emails within seconds. Not much to say he is one of the best profs in this uni would take again in a heartbeat.
Only complain: Labs are sometimes a bit unclear"
1,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,As long as you attend the lectures and take some time to understand the material Gohary is one of the best professors you can take. 
2,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"This professor responds to emails in 2-3m most days no joke! On top of all of this, he is talented and makes a very difficult course look easy. If anyone says this professor is bad they are simply lying because they did not put the effort needed to pass the course. 10/10 would recommend"
3,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Excellent Professor, his live lectures were all great. He makes everything very clear and is very good at answering questions/clarifying concepts.
10/10, would recommend!"
4,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Great professor! Absolutely loved his class. Explained things super well. Really cares for his students and want them to do well. If you attend the lectures and do the homework he gives, you should be able to do well in the course."
5,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Gohary is one of the most talented lectures in the department. All of his lectures are fascinating and will go over things you missed if you ask. Go to class
6,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Prof. Gohary is great! His lectures are really informative and have a great amount of depth. Additionally, he is humorous and always made the lectures interesting. The material itself is not the easiest, so make sure to pay attention to the lectures, do the homework sets, and thoroughly understand the labs. Overall, I had a great experience!"
7,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Honestly the best prof I have ever encountered. I won't say the class is easy but if you attend and pay attention you will be good, and if you need any extra help he would def be accessible outside of class. He is just a great guy, helped me with school and non-school related subjects. I would 100% recommend!!"
8,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Hand's down the best prof I have had so far. Really wants you to understand the material and gives you everything needed to do so. You need to put in a lot of work outside of class reviewing the notes, so I recommend playing close attention to his words and diagrams in class and using his provided Toward's Hardware/Software packages as study notes"
9,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,One of the most caring professors you will ever meet. He gives you tough dad vibes where he acts tough in class but he really cares a lot about his students. He taught the course really well given the circumstances. Doesn't allow phones in class which is for the better.
10,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Lol good prof.
11,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Many students from non-computer majors come in and watch his lectures. He is extremely knowledgeable, funny, and engaging. The midterm and exams are hard, but he truly does want every student to pass. He changed the grading scheme when a lot of people failed the midterm to ensure those students could still pass."
12,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Excellent Professor that puts genuine effort into his lectures. Very generous with midterm marking and wants everyone to do well. Easy A if you go to his lectures since he explains everything very well in them.
13,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Lectures were really good. writes everything on the board makes you more engaged with material. Expectations for midterm/exam weren't too far fetched. one of the better profs. Some quotes: SIR! Did u pay tuition? then ask your question!!! the homework questions depend on what I had for dinner last night My job is to make you happy
14,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Ramy was the best Prof i ever had . I love the way he doesnt let the students to use their cellphones and laptops. it REALLY helped. Loved his homework and and quizzes on Fridays. I could see how passionate he was when he taught. I wish I could have him for all of my courses.
15,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"What an amazing prof! Prof Gohary really took his time to explain every single concept in the lectures, even the small details and was always available for questions outside of class. His grading schemes make it very easy to get an A if you work for it. You could not ask for a better prof!!"
16,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,One of the best professors at Carelton. Love the way he teaches .
17,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3503,"Clear, Helpful and Interesting. All in all, a great professor."
18,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,Amazing prof. Gonna see him again next year
19,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Great, interesting prof and lectures. Explains everything about the course, you could probably understand it straight out of highschool. Looks for opportunities to help his students out, not just with their learning but also marks. Do all the homeworks without procrastinating, and you'll do great. Very fair final and midterm. Easy labs. Fave prof."
20,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Gives great lectures and is always happy to help in office hours. There are tests every few weeks based on the homework (so do the homework for sure!!) which keeps you up to date throughout the semester. Exam was fair, test and labs were marked easily and there were bonus marks on the midterm. Also, he usually drops one quiz!"
21,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Great course, great teacher. when u ask a question, explains the answer instead of just saying it. can find textbook online but u dont ever really need it. Do the problem sets!!! His solutions to the problem sets had a couple simple mistakes like writing 3/7 instead of 3/8. get 100% on labs easy. do hw for quizzes & midterm. easy final."
22,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"good prof. do your hw, moderately hard mid, easy final. "
23,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Very helpful prof. If you dont understand something, ask! He will take the time to clarify in the lecture or during office hours and makes sure you understand. Buy the textbook! If you can do the few problems in the book, you will do great on his quizs or exams.  "
24,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Cannot go wrong with Dr Gohary. He's an excellent lecturer (handwriting does need a little work ;) ), and genuinely wants every student taking his course to succeed. The course is an easy A, as long as you're willing to dedicate time to the homework he gives."
25,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,DO THE PROBLEM SETS! I didnt and thats reflected in my grade. If you did the problem sets.. easy A
26,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Ramy is super-disorganized and his lecturers are a mess. That said, his examples are useful and often straight from the book. The weekly quiz is usually easy if you understand what's going on. Labs are an easy joke. His midterm is just like the homework, and 56 of the final questions THE SAME as homework questions. Same numbers and everything."
27,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"One of the best (if not the best) professors you will find at the Engineering Department at Carleton. If you have the opprtunity to take one of his courses, do it."
28,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"One of the best profs at Carleton. He makes what could be a boring class interesting. He also is very passionate about what he teaches. If you do poorly on a midterm or quiz, he usually gives an opportunity for students to bounce back and receive a good grade. Attend lectures as he gives examples that are usually on the quizzes or exams."
29,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"Prof. Gohary is the best professor I have had in my three years at Carleton.  He genuinely cares about his students.  In our class of about 40 people, he learned every single student's name.  His quizzes every other week keep you up to date without being too stressful, and his grading is very fair.  Come and listen in class and you will do well."
30,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC4600,Very helpful when you approach him with questions. Very respectful and polite to students. Great Professor. Class was very math heavy but he was more than willing to teach background concepts first. He expects students to do the assigned problems. Midterm and final were fair and based on assigned problems. Definitely recommend this Professor.
31,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC4907,"Ramy is by many accounts one of the best profs you could have for the capstone project. But beware, you won't get by if you're slacking. The projects he runs require a lot of work, thinking, and the correct use of engineering and research principles. I had a great time during the project, and it was invaluable for my future. I 100% recommend him."
32,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5004,"Convex Optimization course is mathematically heavy, but Ramy has his own way to dissect concepts into digestible chunks. He is always available outside the class. Exams are not that tough. He is kind and caring. He is a funny guy. You won't feel boredom because he is very energetic. By far one of the best. God bless him."
33,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,His lectures are clear and to the point. Conducts biweekly quizzes which are helpful for the final preparation. Grading is fair enough.
34,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,One of the best professors at Carleton University. Frequent quizzes are helpful for the final preparation and also to improve grades.
35,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,I have taken his master course for advanced digital communication. He is one of the tough grader and won't pass you easily. Out of 45 student around 25 student get to the final exam. He passed only few. I recommend you to not take his course.
36,Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,Professor Ramy is one of the best teachers in Carleton. He is amazing and will inspire you through his lectures.
37,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH1005,"Lectures were hard to follow -- even when learning brand new concepts, Prof. Hua skipped a lot of steps when explaining and going through solutions. Nice guy but if you ask a question about material covered earlier (like gr. 12 or in previous lectures) he'll laugh, say something along the lines of ""you should know this already, no?"" and move on.  
"
38,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH1005,Speaks more clearly than the reviews here made me think before I took his class. I can't imagine why some people find his accent so hard to understand.
39,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH1005,"He tries his best to explain. Assignments, tutorials and sample problems were straight forwards but tests/exam were insane. Solving for variables in the middle of problems or working backwards when he never went over any of those problem types. May be an online thing to prevent cheating but I would avoid."
40,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH2004,"He just shows his students solving an example question step followed by step but never explaining why we have to solve this question in such this way. It is not hard to understand his example questions, but if you paraphrase the question and change all values in that question then it becomes hard."
41,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH2004,Cant say good or not just hard to follow
42,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3705,"Good lectures for a difficult topic. Slight accent can make it difficult to understand, but if you can get past it he is very knowledgeable about the math. Difficult to get help over email with online class, better to ask your question during the class where he will take the time to show the solution. Textbook is good."
43,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3800,"I have taken his 3800 and 2004 in winter 2022, both courses are online and the attendance were not mandatory, however, his lectures are nice and straightforward, he mentioned which part might need to take a serious care for tests and which would not. I would love to take his class again "
44,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3800,"Released notes for the whole semester on the first day. He goes through many examples in the lectures. 
His tests were all multiple choice, which I am not a fan of, but they are pretty easy if you went through the lectures or notes. "
45,Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3800,"The guy tries his best and is really nice, but it is incredibly difficult to follow in lectures. If you get your hands on old assignments and midterms, the class is a breeze because they are almost identical."
46,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,16061,very hard
47,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,201333,Excellent prof. with a challenging midterm and final.  Readily able to relate information to students and willing to clarify when necessary.
48,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,94201,Ahhhh its the chicken lady!
49,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,94201,"easy midterm, killer final....did anyone know she's an olympic swimmer"
51,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,94202,very nice midterms
52,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"Professor Marshal is one of the best professors in the Eng dept. Her lectures explain everything you need to know, and all her TAs are accessible outside of class via Discord & email. As long as you watch the lectures, the assignments and labs won't be a problem whatsoever. Extremely organized professor, and explains everything thoroughly & easily."
53,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,The course page was very disorganized and the midterm and final exam we're so difficult. It was not a hard class but she made the final exam soooooo hard when it did not reflect what we learned in class.
54,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"doesnt care about students at all. Try to reason with her about unfair marking and she dismisses u. Wants you to fail. Beginners in comp. sci. will have an extremely difficult time trying to ""learn"" from her and from ""professor"" yuu ono. Worst experienced with human beings I have ever had in my life. Ask for ALL lab criteria, bc they try to hide it"
55,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"Horrible Professor 0/100. Had to submit Labs in the semester, through CULearn, where you sign in using your student account. I had to submit two labs in the same week, which is typical. I forgot to put my name on them. I got a 0/100 on both because my name wasn't on the submission file, submitted through my account. But they knew who to email."
56,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1042,Final exams are worth a lot of the grade and it doesn't reflect what was learned in the class. Does not explain well and the CUlearn page is so disorganized it's hard to find the material and you miss some important information.
57,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"continuing from below, DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TEAMMATES WHO DONT EVEN PARTICIPATE, PROF WILL DO NOTHING GOOD FOR U FOR THESE HAPPENINGS. and also, whoever says 'dont worry. i will finish my work done soon' thats a completely lie, just ignore that person as soon as ur team deadline is over. i should have done this instead of communicate with prof"
58,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"4 ppl group project, it was really painful to do the group assignment because one guy never showed and the other guy showed up 4 hours before the submission all the time ,we had to rearranged lol. just me and another member did basically everything and managed schedules. team contract does nothing and the prof took no action to the trouble we had."
59,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"Amazing prof. Puts a lot of effort into her CUlearn page and lectures. You need to put in a lot of work in her classes, but the expectations are very clear. I would take her again"
60,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"One of my favourite profs I've had. She genuinely wants her students to do well. She can be particular on how things are done and submitted, but is always super clear on what she expects beforehand. Easy to do well if you put in some effort."
61,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Ecor1041-1042 She is a nice professor and has good structure in her lectures. I tend to ask a lot of questions to ensure a thorough understanding of the criteria because sometimes it isn't explicit. I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material. It is more difficult than it needs to be."
62,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Can't write a coherant question to save her, yells you to read the text book for course material , isn't hard but the exam was very crammed for no reason. cuLearn page is well thought out but poorly executed."
63,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Culearn page is confusing at best, exam times too short for what is expected, She is way too vague in her answers to questions, this was for Ecor1041 which she teaches but wasn't an option to choose."
64,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"The workload is too heavy, but you guess what - you perfectly did an assignment for 8 hours which only worth 0.5% and you did a three-hour test worth 50%!! This means even you work so hard and get everything prepared, you still would get a terrible grade eventually. The lecture is so-so, actually not that effective. Take the textbook seriously."
65,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,She was a good prof. She had a set of her own notes so it her lectures was easy to follow. Definitely recommend to practice and study on your own. Midterm was easy but final was hard. The labs require some work but it is doable.
66,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Very tough
67,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,She is the best guys. Believe me.
68,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She has the most monotone voice I have ever heard. I used to fall asleep every single lecture. Drink a coffee before hand. 1606 is an easy course. She explains things in a clear way, especially for the students who are complete noobs to coding. Overall, good prof"
69,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Dr marshall was a good prof. I dont think the content of 1606 doesn't lend itself to interesting lectures but she made an effort to make it fun. Try your best to follow along with her code during in-class examples. The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track. The course material is easy but be careful not to slack off too much.
70,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"ECOR1606 Doesnt actually teach, just talks and types and doesnt get the class involved. You actually learn how to do stuff in the lab sessions. There is almost no need to show up to her class after the second week."
71,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Given the content of this class the lectures are extremely boring, however Lynn is excellent at explaining the material. This class is very manageable if you keep on top of it and it is fairly easy to get a good lab mark."
72,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"zyBooks is this course's homework. Complete a chapter every 1-2 weeks if you like keeping up with lectures. Do the Mock Midterms/Finals PASS sends out. Go to the takeup,helps prepare you. Typing up in-class examples as the prof does them helps you out. You can follow along in the textbook too. Doing Problem sets 2-3 helps for the Lab Midterm."
73,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"ECOR 1606 is a easy but boring course that is slow for 5/6 of the course then picks up at the end. Lynn is a good prof for this course, as you know what is expected of you. Her reviews for any of the evaluations very well done and extremely helpful."
74,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,classes  are not vivid
75,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She is an amazing professor. Tough assignments, fair midterm and easy lab final. I would take another class with her without hesitation."
76,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Well shes a fair prof . Midterms and lab final is fairly easy . Assigments are hard a bit .Final exam was extremly hard .  I would take a class with her again anytime though . Love the way she teaches
77,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,So far she is awesome!!
78,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"This prof is perfect if you've never had any experience programming. She is slow. Sooo sllloowww. Make sure you're energized and awake prior to coming to class, sit closer to the front, do ALL the assignments BY YOURSELF (if you skip one, make sure you understand how to do it perfectly) and you'll likely ace the course. Do past exams as well."
79,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Well, pretty hard on assignments."
80,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Great teacher, friendly, also great swim coach for masters"
81,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She is such a great teacher. Very Helpful to her students. If you attend ALL her classes, its an easy A+. I didnt take programming in highschool and that was my first programming calss, she made me love it with passion."
82,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,DO NOT take a class with her! She is not that bad with teaching but she is very very very tough with marking and creating questions for tests and finals. She has a very tough marketing scheme! Hard to gain enough marks to pass before the final! Her final is ridiculously hard! It felt like a 3rd year final!
83,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"If you took even one high school programming class, you should be good for ECOR 1606. I'm having her for ECOR 1606. 50% of the class was using while loops and if statements. Really easy if you took programming (even you took only one grade 9 or 10 class). She's such a nice and fun teacher. I always enjoyed going to her class."
84,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She's very tough prof. She makes the assignments very hard, but the written and the lab  midterms were fair. Over all she's not bad"
85,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Very Nice Prof, take Ecor1606 with her only. and yeah she is a great swimmer, swimming coach and world record holder. same goes with programming"
86,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"I find her an awesome prof for programming ,,,, I would take other programming courses with her in future!"
87,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Terrible teacher. She is rude and makes you not want to ask her anything ever again. Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor). So useless. I hope I never have her again."
88,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Not a pleasant person to talk to if you have questions. Heavily dependant on online material. Lectures boring but helpful in tests. Strict marker
89,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Class slides are from the lecture notes, both of which are full of errors. She usually goes over the assignment the lecture after it's assigned. Read the lecture notes and skip the lectures that don't help with the assignment. Vague assignments with specific wants. Very against anything new or different in assignments. Horrible prof."
90,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Professor Marshall is really great. 1606 isn't an easy class to teach and programming can be pretty dry in the class, but she tries really hard to make it clear for those who haven't done any computer stuff before. She and Prof.Bryant use a text and system they created, and it's a really great ease in to the world of programming."
91,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Skipped maybe 23/25 lectures. Then I realized she's a great person, but during the lectures, it's almost as if she's explaining the concept to herself and not the class; it's hard to stay focused on what's going on. Very helpful in person, she usually comes to visit the labs.  Do the labs with their bonuses. Solve previous exams/midterms, ur set."
92,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Lynn marshall well it's lynn marshall watching paint dry is more interesting than her lectures. The labs are great but long. Her midterm was fair but that exam, I don't think I've had an exam so long before. I also found it hilarious how she does all her by hand methods in matlab and confuses herself in lectures."
93,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"She's an awesome prof. As long as you pay attention in class and do the labs including the bonus parts, you're good. You can always follow her and ask her questions if you don't get anything and she'll be willing to help you out. I'd definitely recommend you to take this course with her."
94,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"I learned the entire course by doing the labs. This prepared me for the MATLab section of the class whereas youtube tutorials taught me the ""by hand"" methods. Overall, the lecture portion was boring as scripting can only be learned through practice, and it is hard to follow the ""by hand"" method when she relies heavily on MATLab."
95,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"This is a boring class in the first place but she teaches it well and manages to make some of it interesting. Her lectures are great but it is hard to tell exactly what will be on the midtermfinal. If this course has PASS, GO TO THE MOCK MIDTERMFINAL!!!"
96,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,Amazing prof. Take this course with her! She has all the notes posted online and she is very helpful and replies to emails fast.  
97,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"One of the most thorough profs, she covers all grounds and lets you know exactly what you need to do to do well, she allows students to succeed through her online notes, so you dont need to go to her classes, her online notes let you know everything, just like a programming course should"
98,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Awful. Her in-class examples which are full of mistakes, do nothing to prepare you for lab tests. Any assignments or practice labs she says to do also have little to do with lab tests she marks. You'll be struggling to gain enough marks to pass."
99,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"I don't actually understand all the negativity, and not just from the comments, I've heart people personally tell me this too.  I had her for SYSC 2002 as well, and didn't find she was bad, attendance to the lectures I found actually helped, more so that I thought.  She was especially helpful for 2606, this is how it should be taught."
101,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC1606,"She is really rude especially when you ask questions! Makes you not wanting to ask questions anymore! She doesn't realize not everyone, who does this subject, has done programming before!"
102,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"STAY AWAY!! thats all I can say. Her classes are boring. Does not know how to teach. She is too fast and she is strict in marking. Try to avoid her as long as you can. There is only one worst prof than her in the systems department, and that is John Bryant!"
104,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"Uses examples as much as she can, and explains things in great detail should u need such an explanation"
105,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"This was a very interesting class.  Some of the stuff at the end (like Linked List and everything it led up to), I found helpful for the classes, although if they are still selling the course notes, than I'd suggest buying those and reading them on your own time which beat attending lectures.  Not the greatest prof, but could be worse."
106,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"Had her for summer session of ECOR 1606 and I didn't like her much because I felt she taught for those who already had a programming background. This year was different though. After adjusting to programming lingo and what not, I found her to be very...interesting, in terms of her lectures. Course notes are very helpful, and she expands during lecs"
107,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,she is soo hard it isnt even funny people fail and hard to get really good grade coz she doesnot care at all she is too fast in class for second year c++ course she expects too much ot of us at this level where are only previous expierience to this programming was ECOR 1606.
108,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"she is rude, and show no-patience when u asking question . and her lecture is pretty boring , just like she is reading note(slide)one word by one word.try to avoid her ,if u wanna get a better grade."
109,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"Least committed prof I've ever had. Only in her office during office hours, a total of two hours that never fit my schedule. Even in her office, when I found the free time, she was never any help. A completely discouraging prof. Carleton should realize she's making students either hate or not mind this subject, but never like it more (her job)."
110,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"TERRIBLE!!! I was just reading the other comments about her, and I'm not alone. I asked her about an assignment I had a small problem with, she told she can't help me, and to debug it! I then went to Bryant and he fixed my program. The most useless, boring and atrociously mean person. She should focus on swimming. I just wish I had Bryant."
112,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,doesnt know how to teach......stands up in front of the class and reads off slide.....but on the other hand she had a very very easy exam (cuz she didnt teach the better half of the course) ....anyways take sysc-2002 with anyone but her.
113,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,She is ok teacher but maybe not a nice person. Very mean.
114,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She wants you to succeed. There are SO many opportunities for bonus marks it's not even funny. Every bonus opportunity is also a meaningful example to engage with the course material in a practical way.

Her brightspace page is also organized really well with plenty examples and videos of her walking through solutions.

You can't do poorly in this."
115,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"Amazing prof. Great lectures, fair exams, always available for questions. Very fun class overall."
116,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"This Professor does an awful job teaching online. Her lectures are very confusing considering that they are all pre-recorded videos from pervious years. I've had her as a prof for 4 diff courses, & my experience keeps getting worse and worse. The best part? A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq. "
117,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,She really cares about her students. Responds to emails quickly. Lots of bonuses in the class (around an extra 7%) which will really help. Final was long and had a few tough questions.
118,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,Very good prof. Explains the lecture well. Make sure you do ALL labs and assignments by yourself and prepare before class at least.
119,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She does not explain well. Uses online references mostly instead of her own explanation for the course material. Her own version of online course contents crashes at least once a month that too before the assignment submission. In general, she is a really bad instructor."
120,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She was a fairly easy prof, and unlike ppl below I found her pretty helpful when I went to her office hours (once!) she had  very straightforward exams too just look at previous years..."
121,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"I THINK SHE IS A *******, EASY MIDTERM AND HARD AND LONG FINAL EXAM"
122,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"The gem of the engineering department. Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there. She very clearly explains everything you need to know at a pace that makes it easy to learn, and is easily accessible outside of class if you need help"
123,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"If I were you, I'd avoid taking classes with Lynn Marshall. She posts pre-recorded videos from 2019, takes days to respond to simple emails , creates difficult midterms and finals and isn't really the nicest or most encouraging person out there."
124,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,Best prof ever
125,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"Prof. Marshall is really great! Her lectures are extremely well organized and she goes through many examples to further understanding. The grading criteria is also very clear. The labs/assignments were fairly simple. I found the midterm and final to be moderately difficult, but overall fair. If you are up-to-date in this course, you will do well!"
126,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"Good prof, the people who don't do well in the class don't do the work. She provides plenty of material, practice and homework on her culearn (I don' think any other prof puts as much effort as her into her culearn). The lectures were good even though a bit boring at times. Definitely couldn't ask for a better prof for comp sci"
127,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,The worst professor ever. She writes the hardest exams on earth. She wants people to keep on failing and not passing her course. I heard she is good in Ecor 1606 but in sysc 2006 shes hell.
128,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC202,"A good prof, MUST attend all of her lectures. actually the notes by Mr.Bryant are also pretty good. Gave us a good (easy) final exams , since we didnot cover the hard stuff (and the main stuff of this course) i.e trees, hashing, and parsing .."
129,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3100,HORRIBLE. The TFTP project she gave us did not prepare us at ALL for the concurrency programming she tested us on on the midterm and final.  I don't know how I passed the course!
130,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"All in she's a good prof. That said DO NOT take 3303 with her in the summer, she expect you to do 12 weeks of spread out work in 6 weeks and still marks hard (no clear marking scheme). She also writes marathon exams and midterms like go into the exam and try to do as much as possible correctly not finish cause u wont. Expect to do late nights."
131,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"Nice person, pretty good teacher. You shouldn't have a problem with her. That said, she has some pretty annoying teaching problems: she marks by removing marks whenever you do something wrong, which is a problem because she asks vague questions with specific answers in mind. She also makes you memorize arbitrary things (e.g. opcode NUMBERS)."
132,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"teaching OK, but given a piece of long exam and midterms."
133,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,KNOWS NOTHING! **** DESCRIBES HER BEST
134,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,she cant teach
136,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,She knows the subject very well.  Gives great lectures and the notes are good.  She is pretty helpful when you ask her questions.  Very strict marker however... And the midterms and final were a bit too long.
137,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,Not a nice lady... has an intimidating presence.  Likes to give long and hard midterms and even harder finals.  Extremely picky at marking - must have perfect syntax.  Not very helpful when you speak to her either - will make you wish you didn't ask.
138,Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC4907,Super organized! great 4th year project supervisor. Good feedback. Understanding and keeps you motivated. Schedules weekly meetings to encourage team for progress. Pleasant to work with. very responsive and easy to get in touch with. Happy to have my 4th year project supervised by her!
139,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,Terrible in every way
140,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,Terrible prof worst possible
141,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,The only reason I got an A in this class was because I had prior experience programing. She did not actually run any lectures but prepared the course material for instructors. The lecturers were poor and hard to learn from. The labs instructions were unclear and poorly written. The exam contained a section that was not covered on in class. 
142,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,Just overall a terrible prof labs and tests are worded horribly 
143,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"This class is really poorly coordinated. You only see the Profs in pictures on the course brightspace page. The lectures are recorded by another Prof which quickly goes over things like it's a revision whereas in reality most people never learnt programming before. Apparently this course is easy for people with experience, but no experience u'r f"
144,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"She does not even teach her class. Just uses videos from a couple of years ago and says go to town. Do not expect to get much help unless you are talking with a TA. Coming from having little but some programming experience the class is not all that bad for me. However, I cannot imagine it for people that do not have any experience at all."
145,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"This is how her class goes; -lectures are 2-year-old comp science lectures. let me remind you this is an eng course - she doesn't teach these lectures its another lady, who still doesn't beat Youtube -if I hadn't have had any knowledge of coding before entering the course I would have failed -didnt actually learn anything i"
146,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Quite possibly one of the worst professors Ive ever had. All of the lectures werent made or recorded by her, emails are condescending and exams are disproportionately hard compared to the class work. Came into this class with zero coding experience and Im confident in saying Ill never touch it again because of this course."
147,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,The professors in these courses do not seem to care. They did not even make the lectures themselves. The course content had nothing to do with the weekly labs that took hours upon hours every week. Finally the content comes into play in a ridiculously hard exam that is proctored. This class is like getting thrown into the ocean with weights on
148,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Getting paid to not do a single piece of work. TAs mark everything, run labs and answer all the questions. Lectures are extremely old from a completely different teacher and barely cover the course material properly. Awful teacher overall."
149,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"This course is all about Python coding stuff, from someone who have never code before, it was already pretty difficult to do this class. Plus this prof is not helping at all since the lecture are some prerecorded video(not even her who recorded) that sometimes it doesn't help at all either, TA are doing 99% of the work and the workload are insane."
150,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,I would rate a 0 if I could. All the other ratings you see here are true btw
151,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"If Im being honest, this prof is very lazy. She has not recorded one single lecture but instead uses old videos from previous years. She assigns work that takes 8+ hours to do weekly (labs are only supposed to be 3 hours) then makes all the TA do the dirty work with the grading. All she does is send passive-aggressive emails to students. Waste of $"
152,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,It's like she wasn't even the professor for the class. All the lectures were pre-recorded and featured a different prof from a while back. The worst part is the unforgiving amount of work.
153,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Didn't record a single lecture throughout the entire class, learned from videos made years ago by a different prof."
154,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,We were expected to do work that we have never learned before and there was not much resources for us to self teach ourselves either. They think it is the only class that we have and they normally have labs and quizzes due so close to the day of exams(1 day range)!
155,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Expect weekly quizzes on the textbook. Labs are mostly copied from online sources, and the midterm and final were filled with spelling and grammar mistakes that made understanding extremely difficult. Lectures were just videos from several years ago that weren't even made by the profs."
156,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Personally, I don't think she deserves the rate she has right now, she taught the course material pretty well with examples and seemed knowledgeable. PS I have python experience so the programming in this class was pretty easy. But your mileage might very well vary, I know a couple who struggled because of the lack of python experience."
157,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,she genuinely makes no sense. Its very hard to understand her and she cuts you off before you even finish asking your question. I also have no idea how I am doing in the course as the final exam is in 3 days and I haven't received any of my grades (apart from 3 quizzes that brightspace provides the grade back instantly). 
158,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,The things that are taught in class will dont help you at all with the labs and the exam is more difficult than it should be. If you have never coded before university good luck. 
159,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"worst thing about this prof is their grade 2 English level. Spend more time trying to understand a test question that is riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes than actually doing the question. Cristina if your able to understand this review, please invest in Grammarly."
160,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Horrible professor, truly the worst person to teach first year engineers, you should never take any of her classes. You will be spending every moment of your first year doing the labs and studying cause she doesn't teach you anything. The final in itself was a mess, way too many questions of such a high difficulty level that you will never pass. "
161,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Doesn't actually teach anything in the lectures, you're better off using youtube or teaching yourself in any way. Instructions are always unclear on labs and assignments, which causes you to lose grades. Personally, I don't understand how this professor is still allowed to teach this class, given how there's not a single person likes her. "
163,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,Stay on top of ur labs
164,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,Just overall feels like being set up for failure
165,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,Marking is very strict and work is very unclear. There was a question on the exam that was not even possible to solve. When I went to ask for the grade she said there was nothing she could do. Lectures were recorded a few years ago and the content is all over the place as if the lectures were frankensteined together.
166,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"In all honesty, get ready to research half things that are mentioned in class. MOST of the lectures were recorded by some other prof, and she contributes very little to them. When asked during her office hours about lecture stuff, she stumbles a lot, almost as if she never even cared to watch the lectures. I honestly would never have her again."
167,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"The work load was very heavy. Lectures were often not recorded by her instead by a different prof who can't be reached. Many topics in 1042 felt like they were last minute add in's so the slides would often have grammar issues and problems that were solved wrong. Overall messy and disorganized, I recommend going to outside sources for assistance."
168,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"same thing as the last ecor 1041, i want my money back at this point, why am i in university if teachers are like that? i can literally teach myself everything and be more productive than this course, so much stress... i wish that they reconsider her cause, if that is for the rest of my uni... im quitting, i can learn all those things online."
169,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"It's like ECOR 1041 but worse. Again, same condescending emails, unhelpful lectures from a few years ago, and unrelated labs as well as a difficult proctored final. The profs (if they even exist) don't care."
170,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Lectures are vague and aren't recorded by the actual professor, midterms and exams are unnecessarily difficult, emails and discussion answers are very poorly answered condescendingly. Came into this course happy to learn about coding and left questioning if I want to stay in the field."
171,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1044,"simply doesn't care about students, very passsive aggressive and condescending emails, unfair assignments('intro course' btw) . Went into this course excited to learn python, ended up dreading it. She thinks this is the only course we have, please do better madam we didn't pay you to send us previous years lectures, at least reuse good lectures."
172,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2004,I took the course as an online offering in 2021. She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab. The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project. She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms. Her exams were insanely difficult. 
173,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Dr. Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice. Learning C isn't easy for most, and she does make the effort to ensure people mostly understand the concepts. "
174,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Dr. Martin is much better in person, although she has little control over the exams, she delivers course content in the most digestible manner possible. Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr. Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well. Most of the poor reviews are from salty first years."
175,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews). She takes an effort to answer questions and does a lot of examples/visual explanations, which is much needed for a programming class. She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to. The material can be confusing, but the practice exams they give out are really helpful."
176,Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,She is very different in-person! She always explains questions with care and lots of examples. She will try her best to understand your question and help you visualize the problem. The Exam and Midterm is worth a lot but that's how engineering be.
