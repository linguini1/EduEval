Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Amazing prof, shows true passion while teaching. Makes sure everything is understandable. Responds to emails within seconds. Not much to say he is one of the best profs in this uni would take again in a heartbeat.
Only complain: Labs are sometimes a bit unclear"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,As long as you attend the lectures and take some time to understand the material Gohary is one of the best professors you can take. 
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"This professor responds to emails in 2-3m most days no joke! On top of all of this, he is talented and makes a very difficult course look easy. If anyone says this professor is bad they are simply lying because they did not put the effort needed to pass the course. 10/10 would recommend"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Excellent Professor, his live lectures were all great. He makes everything very clear and is very good at answering questions/clarifying concepts.
10/10, would recommend!"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Great professor! Absolutely loved his class. Explained things super well. Really cares for his students and want them to do well. If you attend the lectures and do the homework he gives, you should be able to do well in the course."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Gohary is one of the most talented lectures in the department. All of his lectures are fascinating and will go over things you missed if you ask. Go to class
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Prof. Gohary is great! His lectures are really informative and have a great amount of depth. Additionally, he is humorous and always made the lectures interesting. The material itself is not the easiest, so make sure to pay attention to the lectures, do the homework sets, and thoroughly understand the labs. Overall, I had a great experience!"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Honestly the best prof I have ever encountered. I won't say the class is easy but if you attend and pay attention you will be good, and if you need any extra help he would def be accessible outside of class. He is just a great guy, helped me with school and non-school related subjects. I would 100% recommend!!"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Hand's down the best prof I have had so far. Really wants you to understand the material and gives you everything needed to do so. You need to put in a lot of work outside of class reviewing the notes, so I recommend playing close attention to his words and diagrams in class and using his provided Toward's Hardware/Software packages as study notes"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,One of the most caring professors you will ever meet. He gives you tough dad vibes where he acts tough in class but he really cares a lot about his students. He taught the course really well given the circumstances. Doesn't allow phones in class which is for the better.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Lol good prof.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Many students from non-computer majors come in and watch his lectures. He is extremely knowledgeable, funny, and engaging. The midterm and exams are hard, but he truly does want every student to pass. He changed the grading scheme when a lot of people failed the midterm to ensure those students could still pass."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Excellent Professor that puts genuine effort into his lectures. Very generous with midterm marking and wants everyone to do well. Easy A if you go to his lectures since he explains everything very well in them.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Lectures were really good. writes everything on the board makes you more engaged with material. Expectations for midterm/exam weren't too far fetched. one of the better profs. Some quotes: SIR! Did u pay tuition? then ask your question!!! the homework questions depend on what I had for dinner last night My job is to make you happy
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Ramy was the best Prof i ever had . I love the way he doesnt let the students to use their cellphones and laptops. it REALLY helped. Loved his homework and and quizzes on Fridays. I could see how passionate he was when he taught. I wish I could have him for all of my courses.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"What an amazing prof! Prof Gohary really took his time to explain every single concept in the lectures, even the small details and was always available for questions outside of class. His grading schemes make it very easy to get an A if you work for it. You could not ask for a better prof!!"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,One of the best professors at Carelton. Love the way he teaches .
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3503,"Clear, Helpful and Interesting. All in all, a great professor."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,Amazing prof. Gonna see him again next year
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Great, interesting prof and lectures. Explains everything about the course, you could probably understand it straight out of highschool. Looks for opportunities to help his students out, not just with their learning but also marks. Do all the homeworks without procrastinating, and you'll do great. Very fair final and midterm. Easy labs. Fave prof."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Gives great lectures and is always happy to help in office hours. There are tests every few weeks based on the homework (so do the homework for sure!!) which keeps you up to date throughout the semester. Exam was fair, test and labs were marked easily and there were bonus marks on the midterm. Also, he usually drops one quiz!"
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Great course, great teacher. when u ask a question, explains the answer instead of just saying it. can find textbook online but u dont ever really need it. Do the problem sets!!! His solutions to the problem sets had a couple simple mistakes like writing 3/7 instead of 3/8. get 100% on labs easy. do hw for quizzes & midterm. easy final."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"good prof. do your hw, moderately hard mid, easy final. "
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Very helpful prof. If you dont understand something, ask! He will take the time to clarify in the lecture or during office hours and makes sure you understand. Buy the textbook! If you can do the few problems in the book, you will do great on his quizs or exams.  "
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Cannot go wrong with Dr Gohary. He's an excellent lecturer (handwriting does need a little work ;) ), and genuinely wants every student taking his course to succeed. The course is an easy A, as long as you're willing to dedicate time to the homework he gives."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,DO THE PROBLEM SETS! I didnt and thats reflected in my grade. If you did the problem sets.. easy A
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Ramy is super-disorganized and his lecturers are a mess. That said, his examples are useful and often straight from the book. The weekly quiz is usually easy if you understand what's going on. Labs are an easy joke. His midterm is just like the homework, and 56 of the final questions THE SAME as homework questions. Same numbers and everything."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"One of the best (if not the best) professors you will find at the Engineering Department at Carleton. If you have the opprtunity to take one of his courses, do it."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"One of the best profs at Carleton. He makes what could be a boring class interesting. He also is very passionate about what he teaches. If you do poorly on a midterm or quiz, he usually gives an opportunity for students to bounce back and receive a good grade. Attend lectures as he gives examples that are usually on the quizzes or exams."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"Prof. Gohary is the best professor I have had in my three years at Carleton.  He genuinely cares about his students.  In our class of about 40 people, he learned every single student's name.  His quizzes every other week keep you up to date without being too stressful, and his grading is very fair.  Come and listen in class and you will do well."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC4600,Very helpful when you approach him with questions. Very respectful and polite to students. Great Professor. Class was very math heavy but he was more than willing to teach background concepts first. He expects students to do the assigned problems. Midterm and final were fair and based on assigned problems. Definitely recommend this Professor.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC4907,"Ramy is by many accounts one of the best profs you could have for the capstone project. But beware, you won't get by if you're slacking. The projects he runs require a lot of work, thinking, and the correct use of engineering and research principles. I had a great time during the project, and it was invaluable for my future. I 100% recommend him."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5004,"Convex Optimization course is mathematically heavy, but Ramy has his own way to dissect concepts into digestible chunks. He is always available outside the class. Exams are not that tough. He is kind and caring. He is a funny guy. You won't feel boredom because he is very energetic. By far one of the best. God bless him."
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,His lectures are clear and to the point. Conducts biweekly quizzes which are helpful for the final preparation. Grading is fair enough.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,One of the best professors at Carleton University. Frequent quizzes are helpful for the final preparation and also to improve grades.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,I have taken his master course for advanced digital communication. He is one of the tough grader and won't pass you easily. Out of 45 student around 25 student get to the final exam. He passed only few. I recommend you to not take his course.
Carleton University,Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,Professor Ramy is one of the best teachers in Carleton. He is amazing and will inspire you through his lectures.
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH1005,"Lectures were hard to follow -- even when learning brand new concepts, Prof. Hua skipped a lot of steps when explaining and going through solutions. Nice guy but if you ask a question about material covered earlier (like gr. 12 or in previous lectures) he'll laugh, say something along the lines of ""you should know this already, no?"" and move on.  
"
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH1005,Speaks more clearly than the reviews here made me think before I took his class. I can't imagine why some people find his accent so hard to understand.
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH1005,"He tries his best to explain. Assignments, tutorials and sample problems were straight forwards but tests/exam were insane. Solving for variables in the middle of problems or working backwards when he never went over any of those problem types. May be an online thing to prevent cheating but I would avoid."
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH2004,"He just shows his students solving an example question step followed by step but never explaining why we have to solve this question in such this way. It is not hard to understand his example questions, but if you paraphrase the question and change all values in that question then it becomes hard."
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH2004,Cant say good or not just hard to follow
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3705,"Good lectures for a difficult topic. Slight accent can make it difficult to understand, but if you can get past it he is very knowledgeable about the math. Difficult to get help over email with online class, better to ask your question during the class where he will take the time to show the solution. Textbook is good."
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3800,"I have taken his 3800 and 2004 in winter 2022, both courses are online and the attendance were not mandatory, however, his lectures are nice and straightforward, he mentioned which part might need to take a serious care for tests and which would not. I would love to take his class again "
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3800,"Released notes for the whole semester on the first day. He goes through many examples in the lectures. 
His tests were all multiple choice, which I am not a fan of, but they are pretty easy if you went through the lectures or notes. "
Carleton University,Eric Hua,MATH3800,"The guy tries his best and is really nice, but it is incredibly difficult to follow in lectures. If you get your hands on old assignments and midterms, the class is a breeze because they are almost identical."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,16061,very hard
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,201333,Excellent prof. with a challenging midterm and final.  Readily able to relate information to students and willing to clarify when necessary.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,94201,Ahhhh its the chicken lady!
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,94201,"easy midterm, killer final....did anyone know she's an olympic swimmer"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,94202,very nice midterms
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"Professor Marshal is one of the best professors in the Eng dept. Her lectures explain everything you need to know, and all her TAs are accessible outside of class via Discord & email. As long as you watch the lectures, the assignments and labs won't be a problem whatsoever. Extremely organized professor, and explains everything thoroughly & easily."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,The course page was very disorganized and the midterm and final exam we're so difficult. It was not a hard class but she made the final exam soooooo hard when it did not reflect what we learned in class.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"doesnt care about students at all. Try to reason with her about unfair marking and she dismisses u. Wants you to fail. Beginners in comp. sci. will have an extremely difficult time trying to ""learn"" from her and from ""professor"" yuu ono. Worst experienced with human beings I have ever had in my life. Ask for ALL lab criteria, bc they try to hide it"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"Horrible Professor 0/100. Had to submit Labs in the semester, through CULearn, where you sign in using your student account. I had to submit two labs in the same week, which is typical. I forgot to put my name on them. I got a 0/100 on both because my name wasn't on the submission file, submitted through my account. But they knew who to email."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1042,Final exams are worth a lot of the grade and it doesn't reflect what was learned in the class. Does not explain well and the CUlearn page is so disorganized it's hard to find the material and you miss some important information.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"continuing from below, DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TEAMMATES WHO DONT EVEN PARTICIPATE, PROF WILL DO NOTHING GOOD FOR U FOR THESE HAPPENINGS. and also, whoever says 'dont worry. i will finish my work done soon' thats a completely lie, just ignore that person as soon as ur team deadline is over. i should have done this instead of communicate with prof"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"4 ppl group project, it was really painful to do the group assignment because one guy never showed and the other guy showed up 4 hours before the submission all the time ,we had to rearranged lol. just me and another member did basically everything and managed schedules. team contract does nothing and the prof took no action to the trouble we had."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"Amazing prof. Puts a lot of effort into her CUlearn page and lectures. You need to put in a lot of work in her classes, but the expectations are very clear. I would take her again"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"One of my favourite profs I've had. She genuinely wants her students to do well. She can be particular on how things are done and submitted, but is always super clear on what she expects beforehand. Easy to do well if you put in some effort."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Ecor1041-1042 She is a nice professor and has good structure in her lectures. I tend to ask a lot of questions to ensure a thorough understanding of the criteria because sometimes it isn't explicit. I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material. It is more difficult than it needs to be."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Can't write a coherant question to save her, yells you to read the text book for course material , isn't hard but the exam was very crammed for no reason. cuLearn page is well thought out but poorly executed."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Culearn page is confusing at best, exam times too short for what is expected, She is way too vague in her answers to questions, this was for Ecor1041 which she teaches but wasn't an option to choose."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"The workload is too heavy, but you guess what - you perfectly did an assignment for 8 hours which only worth 0.5% and you did a three-hour test worth 50%!! This means even you work so hard and get everything prepared, you still would get a terrible grade eventually. The lecture is so-so, actually not that effective. Take the textbook seriously."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,She was a good prof. She had a set of her own notes so it her lectures was easy to follow. Definitely recommend to practice and study on your own. Midterm was easy but final was hard. The labs require some work but it is doable.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Very tough
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,She is the best guys. Believe me.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She has the most monotone voice I have ever heard. I used to fall asleep every single lecture. Drink a coffee before hand. 1606 is an easy course. She explains things in a clear way, especially for the students who are complete noobs to coding. Overall, good prof"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Dr marshall was a good prof. I dont think the content of 1606 doesn't lend itself to interesting lectures but she made an effort to make it fun. Try your best to follow along with her code during in-class examples. The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track. The course material is easy but be careful not to slack off too much.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"ECOR1606 Doesnt actually teach, just talks and types and doesnt get the class involved. You actually learn how to do stuff in the lab sessions. There is almost no need to show up to her class after the second week."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Given the content of this class the lectures are extremely boring, however Lynn is excellent at explaining the material. This class is very manageable if you keep on top of it and it is fairly easy to get a good lab mark."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"zyBooks is this course's homework. Complete a chapter every 1-2 weeks if you like keeping up with lectures. Do the Mock Midterms/Finals PASS sends out. Go to the takeup,helps prepare you. Typing up in-class examples as the prof does them helps you out. You can follow along in the textbook too. Doing Problem sets 2-3 helps for the Lab Midterm."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"ECOR 1606 is a easy but boring course that is slow for 5/6 of the course then picks up at the end. Lynn is a good prof for this course, as you know what is expected of you. Her reviews for any of the evaluations very well done and extremely helpful."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,classes  are not vivid
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She is an amazing professor. Tough assignments, fair midterm and easy lab final. I would take another class with her without hesitation."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Well shes a fair prof . Midterms and lab final is fairly easy . Assigments are hard a bit .Final exam was extremly hard .  I would take a class with her again anytime though . Love the way she teaches
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,So far she is awesome!!
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"This prof is perfect if you've never had any experience programming. She is slow. Sooo sllloowww. Make sure you're energized and awake prior to coming to class, sit closer to the front, do ALL the assignments BY YOURSELF (if you skip one, make sure you understand how to do it perfectly) and you'll likely ace the course. Do past exams as well."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Well, pretty hard on assignments."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Great teacher, friendly, also great swim coach for masters"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She is such a great teacher. Very Helpful to her students. If you attend ALL her classes, its an easy A+. I didnt take programming in highschool and that was my first programming calss, she made me love it with passion."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,DO NOT take a class with her! She is not that bad with teaching but she is very very very tough with marking and creating questions for tests and finals. She has a very tough marketing scheme! Hard to gain enough marks to pass before the final! Her final is ridiculously hard! It felt like a 3rd year final!
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"If you took even one high school programming class, you should be good for ECOR 1606. I'm having her for ECOR 1606. 50% of the class was using while loops and if statements. Really easy if you took programming (even you took only one grade 9 or 10 class). She's such a nice and fun teacher. I always enjoyed going to her class."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She's very tough prof. She makes the assignments very hard, but the written and the lab  midterms were fair. Over all she's not bad"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Very Nice Prof, take Ecor1606 with her only. and yeah she is a great swimmer, swimming coach and world record holder. same goes with programming"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"I find her an awesome prof for programming ,,,, I would take other programming courses with her in future!"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Terrible teacher. She is rude and makes you not want to ask her anything ever again. Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor). So useless. I hope I never have her again."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Not a pleasant person to talk to if you have questions. Heavily dependant on online material. Lectures boring but helpful in tests. Strict marker
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Class slides are from the lecture notes, both of which are full of errors. She usually goes over the assignment the lecture after it's assigned. Read the lecture notes and skip the lectures that don't help with the assignment. Vague assignments with specific wants. Very against anything new or different in assignments. Horrible prof."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Professor Marshall is really great. 1606 isn't an easy class to teach and programming can be pretty dry in the class, but she tries really hard to make it clear for those who haven't done any computer stuff before. She and Prof.Bryant use a text and system they created, and it's a really great ease in to the world of programming."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Skipped maybe 23/25 lectures. Then I realized she's a great person, but during the lectures, it's almost as if she's explaining the concept to herself and not the class; it's hard to stay focused on what's going on. Very helpful in person, she usually comes to visit the labs.  Do the labs with their bonuses. Solve previous exams/midterms, ur set."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Lynn marshall well it's lynn marshall watching paint dry is more interesting than her lectures. The labs are great but long. Her midterm was fair but that exam, I don't think I've had an exam so long before. I also found it hilarious how she does all her by hand methods in matlab and confuses herself in lectures."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"She's an awesome prof. As long as you pay attention in class and do the labs including the bonus parts, you're good. You can always follow her and ask her questions if you don't get anything and she'll be willing to help you out. I'd definitely recommend you to take this course with her."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"I learned the entire course by doing the labs. This prepared me for the MATLab section of the class whereas youtube tutorials taught me the ""by hand"" methods. Overall, the lecture portion was boring as scripting can only be learned through practice, and it is hard to follow the ""by hand"" method when she relies heavily on MATLab."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"This is a boring class in the first place but she teaches it well and manages to make some of it interesting. Her lectures are great but it is hard to tell exactly what will be on the midtermfinal. If this course has PASS, GO TO THE MOCK MIDTERMFINAL!!!"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,Amazing prof. Take this course with her! She has all the notes posted online and she is very helpful and replies to emails fast.  
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"One of the most thorough profs, she covers all grounds and lets you know exactly what you need to do to do well, she allows students to succeed through her online notes, so you dont need to go to her classes, her online notes let you know everything, just like a programming course should"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Awful. Her in-class examples which are full of mistakes, do nothing to prepare you for lab tests. Any assignments or practice labs she says to do also have little to do with lab tests she marks. You'll be struggling to gain enough marks to pass."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"I don't actually understand all the negativity, and not just from the comments, I've heart people personally tell me this too.  I had her for SYSC 2002 as well, and didn't find she was bad, attendance to the lectures I found actually helped, more so that I thought.  She was especially helpful for 2606, this is how it should be taught."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC1606,"She is really rude especially when you ask questions! Makes you not wanting to ask questions anymore! She doesn't realize not everyone, who does this subject, has done programming before!"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"STAY AWAY!! thats all I can say. Her classes are boring. Does not know how to teach. She is too fast and she is strict in marking. Try to avoid her as long as you can. There is only one worst prof than her in the systems department, and that is John Bryant!"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"Uses examples as much as she can, and explains things in great detail should u need such an explanation"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"This was a very interesting class.  Some of the stuff at the end (like Linked List and everything it led up to), I found helpful for the classes, although if they are still selling the course notes, than I'd suggest buying those and reading them on your own time which beat attending lectures.  Not the greatest prof, but could be worse."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"Had her for summer session of ECOR 1606 and I didn't like her much because I felt she taught for those who already had a programming background. This year was different though. After adjusting to programming lingo and what not, I found her to be very...interesting, in terms of her lectures. Course notes are very helpful, and she expands during lecs"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,she is soo hard it isnt even funny people fail and hard to get really good grade coz she doesnot care at all she is too fast in class for second year c++ course she expects too much ot of us at this level where are only previous expierience to this programming was ECOR 1606.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"she is rude, and show no-patience when u asking question . and her lecture is pretty boring , just like she is reading note(slide)one word by one word.try to avoid her ,if u wanna get a better grade."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"Least committed prof I've ever had. Only in her office during office hours, a total of two hours that never fit my schedule. Even in her office, when I found the free time, she was never any help. A completely discouraging prof. Carleton should realize she's making students either hate or not mind this subject, but never like it more (her job)."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,"TERRIBLE!!! I was just reading the other comments about her, and I'm not alone. I asked her about an assignment I had a small problem with, she told she can't help me, and to debug it! I then went to Bryant and he fixed my program. The most useless, boring and atrociously mean person. She should focus on swimming. I just wish I had Bryant."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,doesnt know how to teach......stands up in front of the class and reads off slide.....but on the other hand she had a very very easy exam (cuz she didnt teach the better half of the course) ....anyways take sysc-2002 with anyone but her.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2002,She is ok teacher but maybe not a nice person. Very mean.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She wants you to succeed. There are SO many opportunities for bonus marks it's not even funny. Every bonus opportunity is also a meaningful example to engage with the course material in a practical way.

Her brightspace page is also organized really well with plenty examples and videos of her walking through solutions.

You can't do poorly in this."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"Amazing prof. Great lectures, fair exams, always available for questions. Very fun class overall."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"This Professor does an awful job teaching online. Her lectures are very confusing considering that they are all pre-recorded videos from pervious years. I've had her as a prof for 4 diff courses, & my experience keeps getting worse and worse. The best part? A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq. "
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,She really cares about her students. Responds to emails quickly. Lots of bonuses in the class (around an extra 7%) which will really help. Final was long and had a few tough questions.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,Very good prof. Explains the lecture well. Make sure you do ALL labs and assignments by yourself and prepare before class at least.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She does not explain well. Uses online references mostly instead of her own explanation for the course material. Her own version of online course contents crashes at least once a month that too before the assignment submission. In general, she is a really bad instructor."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She was a fairly easy prof, and unlike ppl below I found her pretty helpful when I went to her office hours (once!) she had  very straightforward exams too just look at previous years..."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"I THINK SHE IS A *******, EASY MIDTERM AND HARD AND LONG FINAL EXAM"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"The gem of the engineering department. Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there. She very clearly explains everything you need to know at a pace that makes it easy to learn, and is easily accessible outside of class if you need help"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"If I were you, I'd avoid taking classes with Lynn Marshall. She posts pre-recorded videos from 2019, takes days to respond to simple emails , creates difficult midterms and finals and isn't really the nicest or most encouraging person out there."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,Best prof ever
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"Prof. Marshall is really great! Her lectures are extremely well organized and she goes through many examples to further understanding. The grading criteria is also very clear. The labs/assignments were fairly simple. I found the midterm and final to be moderately difficult, but overall fair. If you are up-to-date in this course, you will do well!"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"Good prof, the people who don't do well in the class don't do the work. She provides plenty of material, practice and homework on her culearn (I don' think any other prof puts as much effort as her into her culearn). The lectures were good even though a bit boring at times. Definitely couldn't ask for a better prof for comp sci"
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,The worst professor ever. She writes the hardest exams on earth. She wants people to keep on failing and not passing her course. I heard she is good in Ecor 1606 but in sysc 2006 shes hell.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC202,"A good prof, MUST attend all of her lectures. actually the notes by Mr.Bryant are also pretty good. Gave us a good (easy) final exams , since we didnot cover the hard stuff (and the main stuff of this course) i.e trees, hashing, and parsing .."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3100,HORRIBLE. The TFTP project she gave us did not prepare us at ALL for the concurrency programming she tested us on on the midterm and final.  I don't know how I passed the course!
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"All in she's a good prof. That said DO NOT take 3303 with her in the summer, she expect you to do 12 weeks of spread out work in 6 weeks and still marks hard (no clear marking scheme). She also writes marathon exams and midterms like go into the exam and try to do as much as possible correctly not finish cause u wont. Expect to do late nights."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"Nice person, pretty good teacher. You shouldn't have a problem with her. That said, she has some pretty annoying teaching problems: she marks by removing marks whenever you do something wrong, which is a problem because she asks vague questions with specific answers in mind. She also makes you memorize arbitrary things (e.g. opcode NUMBERS)."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"teaching OK, but given a piece of long exam and midterms."
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,KNOWS NOTHING! **** DESCRIBES HER BEST
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,she cant teach
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,She knows the subject very well.  Gives great lectures and the notes are good.  She is pretty helpful when you ask her questions.  Very strict marker however... And the midterms and final were a bit too long.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,Not a nice lady... has an intimidating presence.  Likes to give long and hard midterms and even harder finals.  Extremely picky at marking - must have perfect syntax.  Not very helpful when you speak to her either - will make you wish you didn't ask.
Carleton University,Lynn Marshall,SYSC4907,Super organized! great 4th year project supervisor. Good feedback. Understanding and keeps you motivated. Schedules weekly meetings to encourage team for progress. Pleasant to work with. very responsive and easy to get in touch with. Happy to have my 4th year project supervised by her!
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,Terrible in every way
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,Terrible prof worst possible
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,The only reason I got an A in this class was because I had prior experience programing. She did not actually run any lectures but prepared the course material for instructors. The lecturers were poor and hard to learn from. The labs instructions were unclear and poorly written. The exam contained a section that was not covered on in class. 
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,Just overall a terrible prof labs and tests are worded horribly 
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"This class is really poorly coordinated. You only see the Profs in pictures on the course brightspace page. The lectures are recorded by another Prof which quickly goes over things like it's a revision whereas in reality most people never learnt programming before. Apparently this course is easy for people with experience, but no experience u'r f"
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"She does not even teach her class. Just uses videos from a couple of years ago and says go to town. Do not expect to get much help unless you are talking with a TA. Coming from having little but some programming experience the class is not all that bad for me. However, I cannot imagine it for people that do not have any experience at all."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"This is how her class goes; -lectures are 2-year-old comp science lectures. let me remind you this is an eng course - she doesn't teach these lectures its another lady, who still doesn't beat Youtube -if I hadn't have had any knowledge of coding before entering the course I would have failed -didnt actually learn anything i"
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Quite possibly one of the worst professors Ive ever had. All of the lectures werent made or recorded by her, emails are condescending and exams are disproportionately hard compared to the class work. Came into this class with zero coding experience and Im confident in saying Ill never touch it again because of this course."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,The professors in these courses do not seem to care. They did not even make the lectures themselves. The course content had nothing to do with the weekly labs that took hours upon hours every week. Finally the content comes into play in a ridiculously hard exam that is proctored. This class is like getting thrown into the ocean with weights on
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Getting paid to not do a single piece of work. TAs mark everything, run labs and answer all the questions. Lectures are extremely old from a completely different teacher and barely cover the course material properly. Awful teacher overall."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"This course is all about Python coding stuff, from someone who have never code before, it was already pretty difficult to do this class. Plus this prof is not helping at all since the lecture are some prerecorded video(not even her who recorded) that sometimes it doesn't help at all either, TA are doing 99% of the work and the workload are insane."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,I would rate a 0 if I could. All the other ratings you see here are true btw
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"If Im being honest, this prof is very lazy. She has not recorded one single lecture but instead uses old videos from previous years. She assigns work that takes 8+ hours to do weekly (labs are only supposed to be 3 hours) then makes all the TA do the dirty work with the grading. All she does is send passive-aggressive emails to students. Waste of $"
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,It's like she wasn't even the professor for the class. All the lectures were pre-recorded and featured a different prof from a while back. The worst part is the unforgiving amount of work.
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Didn't record a single lecture throughout the entire class, learned from videos made years ago by a different prof."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,We were expected to do work that we have never learned before and there was not much resources for us to self teach ourselves either. They think it is the only class that we have and they normally have labs and quizzes due so close to the day of exams(1 day range)!
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,"Expect weekly quizzes on the textbook. Labs are mostly copied from online sources, and the midterm and final were filled with spelling and grammar mistakes that made understanding extremely difficult. Lectures were just videos from several years ago that weren't even made by the profs."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Personally, I don't think she deserves the rate she has right now, she taught the course material pretty well with examples and seemed knowledgeable. PS I have python experience so the programming in this class was pretty easy. But your mileage might very well vary, I know a couple who struggled because of the lack of python experience."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,she genuinely makes no sense. Its very hard to understand her and she cuts you off before you even finish asking your question. I also have no idea how I am doing in the course as the final exam is in 3 days and I haven't received any of my grades (apart from 3 quizzes that brightspace provides the grade back instantly). 
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,The things that are taught in class will dont help you at all with the labs and the exam is more difficult than it should be. If you have never coded before university good luck. 
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"worst thing about this prof is their grade 2 English level. Spend more time trying to understand a test question that is riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes than actually doing the question. Cristina if your able to understand this review, please invest in Grammarly."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Horrible professor, truly the worst person to teach first year engineers, you should never take any of her classes. You will be spending every moment of your first year doing the labs and studying cause she doesn't teach you anything. The final in itself was a mess, way too many questions of such a high difficulty level that you will never pass. "
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Doesn't actually teach anything in the lectures, you're better off using youtube or teaching yourself in any way. Instructions are always unclear on labs and assignments, which causes you to lose grades. Personally, I don't understand how this professor is still allowed to teach this class, given how there's not a single person likes her. "
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,Stay on top of ur labs
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,Just overall feels like being set up for failure
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,Marking is very strict and work is very unclear. There was a question on the exam that was not even possible to solve. When I went to ask for the grade she said there was nothing she could do. Lectures were recorded a few years ago and the content is all over the place as if the lectures were frankensteined together.
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"In all honesty, get ready to research half things that are mentioned in class. MOST of the lectures were recorded by some other prof, and she contributes very little to them. When asked during her office hours about lecture stuff, she stumbles a lot, almost as if she never even cared to watch the lectures. I honestly would never have her again."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"The work load was very heavy. Lectures were often not recorded by her instead by a different prof who can't be reached. Many topics in 1042 felt like they were last minute add in's so the slides would often have grammar issues and problems that were solved wrong. Overall messy and disorganized, I recommend going to outside sources for assistance."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"same thing as the last ecor 1041, i want my money back at this point, why am i in university if teachers are like that? i can literally teach myself everything and be more productive than this course, so much stress... i wish that they reconsider her cause, if that is for the rest of my uni... im quitting, i can learn all those things online."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"It's like ECOR 1041 but worse. Again, same condescending emails, unhelpful lectures from a few years ago, and unrelated labs as well as a difficult proctored final. The profs (if they even exist) don't care."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Lectures are vague and aren't recorded by the actual professor, midterms and exams are unnecessarily difficult, emails and discussion answers are very poorly answered condescendingly. Came into this course happy to learn about coding and left questioning if I want to stay in the field."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1044,"simply doesn't care about students, very passsive aggressive and condescending emails, unfair assignments('intro course' btw) . Went into this course excited to learn python, ended up dreading it. She thinks this is the only course we have, please do better madam we didn't pay you to send us previous years lectures, at least reuse good lectures."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2004,I took the course as an online offering in 2021. She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab. The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project. She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms. Her exams were insanely difficult. 
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Dr. Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice. Learning C isn't easy for most, and she does make the effort to ensure people mostly understand the concepts. "
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Dr. Martin is much better in person, although she has little control over the exams, she delivers course content in the most digestible manner possible. Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr. Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well. Most of the poor reviews are from salty first years."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews). She takes an effort to answer questions and does a lot of examples/visual explanations, which is much needed for a programming class. She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to. The material can be confusing, but the practice exams they give out are really helpful."
Carleton University,Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,She is very different in-person! She always explains questions with care and lots of examples. She will try her best to understand your question and help you visualize the problem. The Exam and Midterm is worth a lot but that's how engineering be.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,953005,"clear explanation in class course assignment is very practical"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP1001,"He is very nice prof. Even the midterm is not really easy, but if you review carefully, you can get higher score easily.The assignments are very easy! Even I rarely went to class and I just reviewed slides."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP1001,"Mengchi really is one of the worst professors at Carleton. His midterm was unintelligible, and the class average was in the low 50s. It's not that the material is challenging, it's that Mengchi uses hundreds of slides with irrelevant information and then tests you on random segments of hundreds of pieces of useless information in a nonsense test."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3000,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. The worst computer science professor. He stands with his back to you and uses a laser pointer to read his slides word for word. His assignments are not thought out and not on what he ""taught"". Repeats word for word if you ask a question and he is an a**hole when you email him. Still got an A+ but he shouldn't be allowed to teach"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3000,good prof
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3000,"Yes. He reads from the slides. Yes the slides and assignments are lifted from other sources. BUT his review slides and the assignment questions often are word-for-word what you see on his midterm and final. Take this class, get a good mark, and learn as much or as little as you want from the textbook or other sources."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3000,"Probably the worst prof I've had so far. Very boring; reads word-for-word off slides, which are either from another prof or directly from the textbook (which isn't very good to begin with). Notes are backwards; no consistency to them. Assignments are relatively easy, but tests can be tricky. Grammar errors in all his works. Difficult to understand."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3000,"Avoid this professor if possible. This guy only reads from the slides (which I think he got from other profs, but I'm not sure). No eye contact at all. He's the second worst prof in computer science. If you ask a question, you'll get more confused. At least his courses are easy, and I'm thankful for that"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3000,Horrible prof! Insanely bad!
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Extremely poorly worded assignments (cost me 10% of my final grade). Lectures are fast-paced to the point of professors skipping sides, TAs took over a month to mark each assignment, and office hours are often canceled. Extremely disappointed in this professor and really regret taking this course with him. I recommend staying far away."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"This professor thinks this the only course we are taking. Assigns time consuming work and gives little amounts of time. Though, he does give lots of extensions. His lectures are a mess, he's hard to understand and is not at all helpful when asked for help. He seems like a very nice person but he simply cannot teach to save his life. 3/10"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"All the info youll ever need is in his slides which i can appreciate. Terrible prof otherwise and he tests you on a little too much for the final but if you study hard for the final(a few days of round the clock studying) knowing that hes gonna ask you about turing awards, its not so bad. To be honest comp 3005 is a cakewalk with Mengchi."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Lecture slides are bloated with superfluous information, and you better memorize every last word of it. The responses he gives to questions from students are laughably unhelpful, and the midterm was a logistical trainwreck."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,He had a hard time with the online setup and e-proctoring. Assignments were incredibly long (especially the last 2) and were confusing. He was really accessible outside of class by responding to emails and forums. The material wasn't difficult but the exam was. Lectures were just him reading the slides.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"the only reason im giving this course a difficulty of 5 is because of the prof. The material is straightforward enough if youre so inclined, however if youve never studied databases before, you better hope n pray that your peers can come together as a hive mind and decipher the rosetta stone like information from his slides (all 1000+ of em)."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,He seems like he'd be a really nice person in real life because he gives extensions whenever we ask for them... but this course is useless and taught poorly. dont take it if you don't have to because 50% of its content isn't even used in industry and the prof didnt do a good job on teaching it.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,He is extremely unorganized and uninterested.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Single word answers to specific questions asked, barely responds to emails, the midterm was longer than an assignment and we had to wait to begin the midterm so he could ""confirm our identity"" over BBB (We could leave the call after this...(?)). Useless slides. I have 100% on every assignment but trashed the midterm (who won the turing award btw?)"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,There are no good things that can be said about Mengchi. This professor absolutely does not care about the class he is teaching at all. Assignments and tests are a mess and his slides are terrible.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"For all reading , this might be the worst prof in this university (not exaggerating) . Sometimes I wonder how he got his pHd . He makes so many mistakes , gives u 5 days to do an assignment that he doesn't even know how its done . Fails to communicate with students almost always , and just a terrible attitude showing that hes teaching for the money"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Stay away from him!!! take this course at Ottawa U or with another prof, or run away!!! He is absolutely 0 at teaching, hopefully he is ok at research otherwise why Carleton hired him? waste of osap money if you take it with him, you will learn nothing, will be stressful because you will have to find information online to understand."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"This is the absolute worst prof I've ever had. Do not take it COMP 3005 with him. Unorganized, tests are way too long, rewrites assignments multiple times, gives about a week for assignments that are huge and assignments are confusing because his wording makes no sense half the time. Save yourself a headache and DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE WITH HIM :)"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,If there has been an option to leave 0 rating I would have done so
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,I really would like to enjoy his lecture and learn something useful but unfortunately he just doesn't give me the chance. His wording can be extremely confusing and even self-contradictory. I sometimes feel like that he's just there to check in instead of actually teaching something. This could be a quite useful and enjoyable course. What a pity.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Stay Away from this prof! he has bad english, does not care about students, How he became a professor?"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"This prof is the worst, he drops assignments on you 5 days before they are due, has many mistakes, there are no schedule for assignments in course outline, he is extremely boring, when you watch his lectures you get more confused then if you would have watched some youtube videos. the material is not hard however."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,i had Prof Mengchi for comp 3005 and hes absoultely the worst professor i have ever encountered. So disorganized and doesn't care for students. Sets guidelines but doesn't even follow his own and is strict on students. Monotone voice during lectures and hard to hear back for emails. Beware. Midterm was completely unfair and long as he wasted time.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"I have not learned a single useful thing in this class. I passed this class barely knowing how to use SQL, but hey at least I know who invented relational databases and who is the CEO or Oracle"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,Very bad course experience. Not very helpful to answer questions. Make lots of confusion in his assignment.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"""Hey, I have this one really specific question and A answer to it would really help me with this assignment!"" ""Yes."""
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Nice prof, lecture heavy do homework you will be fine"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Not really hard to learn, and his course is the easier third-year computer science course, you can get a high mark if you can memory his every slide and every line :) Good luck!"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,try to read & memory every single line in the ppt.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Terrible. This course should be easy, but he goes out of his way to make it difficult. Tons of typos and terrible Engrish on his slides. He always posts the assignments really late and gives us about a week to complete them. Terrible lectures. The final is worth 50% and about 80 of 100 questions on it are useless theory"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Reads off years-old slides each class. Barely audible, barely understandable. Doesn't answer questions usefully in class or anywhere else - if you don't get something, you're on your own. One time I asked a question about an assignment in the forum, saying ""Do I use method A or method B?"" His answer was ""Yes."""
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"The class itself is actually not bad, but the way he teaches it is brutal. Get ready to remember who won the Turing award. Exam was a joke, but don't like how he makes the assignments not clear on how much they are worth each. He just reads slides during the lecture, so if you are able to read no need to show up to class."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Do yourself a favour, DONT TAKE 3005 WITH HIM! This course should be easy but he makes it soo much harder than it should be. Terrible slides with tons of syntax/grammar/spelling errors which he doesnt bother fixing. Never responds to questions in the forum, poor communication with the class, he simply doesnt want to be teaching. Awful final exam"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"He just reads his slides word for word without adding any value. If you know how to read, just skip class."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"This is the professor whose amounts of typos are unbelievable, which makes this course much harder than it should be. It is hard to imagine there are so many typos in his notes for teaching this course so many years! But most crazy thing is even if he knew these many typos in his notes, he rarely updated them!"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Don't bother going to class, all he does is read the slides word-for-word. He crams the assignment due dates really close to each other for some reason. Slides/assignments are riddled with spelling and grammatical errors which makes it difficult to understand. Never answers any questions in the forum, does the bare minimum to run the course"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,he is not that bad
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"His lectures are incredibly dry; he just goes through all the examples on his slides. I'd wager 80% of the class doesn't bother attending them. His notes, assignments, solutions, and tests are filled with errors which is very frustrating and unprofessional. All around disorganized and poor at communicating with his class."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Easily the worst prof in the core comp sci program. Course is extremely boring and tedious. Prof makes you do everything like 5 different ways (do this query using ALG, ok now do it again using TRC, ok now DRC, now QBE, now finally SQL ... ok and again using this other SQL way). Theres useful material but a lot of it is outdated stuff from the 70s."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,The professor... he's not very good at teaching. He feels like one of those professors that are there for the sake of having a grant and teaching only because he has to. His slides are riddled with mistakes and he consistently fails to answer student questions during the lectures. He just seems like a very confused person..
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"This is one of the easier third year computer science classes. The material is kind of dry and the professor does not really make much of an effort to make it any more interesting. however, his expectations are very clear and if you come to class and do the assignments you will do very well in the class."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,He reads off of slides that are usually filled with mistakes that he doesn't fix until after he notices or someone points it out during a lecture. Seems like an easy course but there is a lot of content and definitions that needed to be memorized which is especially hard when there are 23 lecture powerpoints with an average of 50 slides per.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Horrible lectures. Reads his 80 slide ppt, which are riddled with errors. You don't need to attend his lectures, just read the 24 ppt presentations with 80 slides each. The midterm and final take up 25% and 50% respectively, so most of your marks are going to come from tests. Assignments are 25% (best 5/6) you can afford to take it easy on those."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"The moment I looked at his slides and saw there were more than 60 pages, I gave up on actually attending lectures. All the info you need to pass the course is on his slides, invalidating any need to actually attend them. Easy course, horribly put together assignments, and a really odd emphasis on theory rather than practice."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,LOL! Too good.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Absolutely the worst Prof I have ever been in a class with. Creates lectures the day of and are riddeled with many errors, fixing them in the middle of a lecture. Requires that TAs follow midterm definitions to a tee; if the student does not include specific words, they will lose marks. Plagiarizes assignment questions from other profs, etc."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,Awful awful prof.  Amazing how he can put together so many slides and have no absorb-able information. Avoid like the plague. If you work hard you can probably get a good mark but you wont learn much about databases.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Honestly the worst prof out of all the profs I've taken courses with. Don't bother going to lectures because you will learn absolutely nothing. Don't expect him to give you any review material or help for that matter. He reads right off the slides, has a very thick accent, and doesn't even both answering questions in class. Avoid at all costs."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,This guy reads his 80 page slides. They're unclear hard to decipher and class attendance is low for that reason.  If you are born with two working eyes then don't bother going
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,very boring. exam questions were very difficult and it is very hard to study for the exam because he goes over a million slides a lecture.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Agree with the other reviews, at least for COMP3005. Reads slides like a text-to-speech editor, and is next to impossible to understand. If your goal is to attend class and take notes, I would suggest you reconsider and attempt to teach yourself with the help of your peers and lecture slides."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Don't take what he's teaching unless it's both mandatory and he's the only one teaching it. He made a point of saying he was Tenured at the start of the class. I thought it was weird, but I soon learned why. Boring and not at all helpful. If you have a question about something he teaches don't waste your time with him and go right to the Internet."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"In this course, I want to kill myself. Seriously, this guy is the most boring teacher I've ever had. He uses slides, reads from them, no eye contact, and uses a mouse to point at text. Terrible. Avoid if possible. A really thick accent too (but not the worst)"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"He should have chosen a different career path. He might know his stuff, but has a very strong accent, and has no teaching skills. What about making the class interesting, colorful, or smth? Uses text files to present the material, explains them horribly. I got an A, but only by studying on my own from supplemental materials."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"He is the worse prof Ive ever had in my entire university career. His notes have incorrect code(queries) in them. If he is teaching some course, do yourself a favor and don't take that course."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"WOW; BAD. Do yourself a favour and drop any courses you've got with him, right now. Words cannot express just how incompetent this man is at teaching. I'm sure he's a brilliant researcher but for the love of God don't let him teach your class."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Entirely agree with other comments - ancient, incomprehensible and uninformative notes riddled with spelling mistakes. Uses obsolete and buggy software for assignments. Very unhelpful over e-mail."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,very nice and helpful.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"A prof interesting on researching, not good at teaching, spent me a lots time self studying....read the book plz, then u get A, if any questions, ask him, he is nice to answer Qs, even tell u more. In class, dont hope so much on him."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Very poor prof. Reads straight from slides, badly maintained website, hard to follow in class, poor assignment timing... the list goes on."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"This guy is out right the worst prof i have had in my university career (6 years).  He is utterly useless in class and even more so if you go in and speak with him.  I would recommend that if you have him as a prof for a course, wait until someone else teaches it."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"I didn't learn anything in class, the assignments were sketchy and if not for a few extended due dates it would have been much worse.  However, the final exam was jokingly easy and i got a 91.11% on it"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"sometime, he does know what he is talking about.!!!!"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"There isn't much I can say that the others below me haven't, so basically, avoid Liu at all costs. Even if it means delaying the course for a semester or two."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,This CLASS + This PROFF = FAIL!!!!!!!!
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"All his notes were in .txt and he had ASCII ER models in there!! He talks very quite and the lectures are boring. But, the exam was very nice."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,Spend most of your time doing assignments and reviewing his lecture notes. Midterms and Exams are fair IF you review the material and attend class. He likes to test people on stuff that he solves in class.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,one of the best
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Notes are full of typos, his assignments are hard to do because his DB wrapper programs are FULL of bugs.  Doesn't care to fix them, takes forever to reply to e-mails.  Lousy."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Please answer questions in english, not in mandarin."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,not bad
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Not helpful whatsoever, his examples never work and when he fixes them even those hardly work"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP4003,"Worst teacher ive ever had, hes terrible on many levels. Very arrogant, no care for students, 100 pg ppt presentations. He reads the slides so dont bother going if you can read. When i took this course, there was an approx <5% attendance rate, by the end of the semester he attempted to punish us by not giving out exam details which he usually does"
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP4003,i hate him
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP4104,"Second worse prof I've had, straight out reads slides word for word in class, notes he took from another prof so the references were incorrect (we used a diff book). His assignments are stolen from the other prof too, but he tries to hide that fact by randomly renaming and deleting stuff, this makes the assignments very hard to understand."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP4104,"Horrible Teacher. Had no knowledge of the material he was ""teaching"". Would not reply to e-mails. Reads directly off slides he did not read. Assignments have 2 or 3 unclear requirements, and when you ask for clarification he says he allready explained in class  (but rarely does). He makes the entire Carleton Computer Science School look bad."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP5305,I have always been a A+ student in my life. This is the first course I am scared to fail. You can guess my thoughts!
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP5305,I have always been a A+ student in my life. This is the first course I am scared to fail. You can guess my thoughts! I am not gonna elaborate any more.
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP5305,"Just a big mistake to take his course. First he said he will do this on the course, than he changed in the middle of the term. For project no help at all. Course is boring and a waste of time."
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,COMP5305,the worst prof i have ever had! I hate this guy!
Carleton University,Mengchi Liu,CS305,"Poor english, bad example, very selfish, ask students to do his collection data project, very stupid!! Never to be his student!!"
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,1902BIOL,best prof at Carleton
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"An A+++++ teacher. He has an amazing sense of humour and his passion for natural history is infectious. I took this course randomly but it ended up being one of my favourites. The tests and exams are all online and aren't that hard, but he does require you to pay attention to some details in the lectures as they could be asked in the exams. "
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Such an enjoyable teacher! Very kind and has good lectures. No note slides given so lectures are pretty much mandatory to watch! Tests reflected what he taught, no trick questions! Even gives you practice tests to help you. I'm a psych major and I actually enjoyed biology for once (: Highly recommend!"
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,Although I didn't talk to him very much one on one I VERY MUCH enjoyed his lectures and could tell how passionate he was about his research and the martial he was covering. I am not in bio and took this for a requirement and he made me interested in the material covered. 
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,So this class is really easy to get a high grade if you watch all of the lectures. I say this because as a biology student not everything he says is 100% correct but if you watch lectures and take notes and study what HE SAYS you will get the right answers. My class was 23 lectures so 2 a week but posted at very random times no schedule. 
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,Very nice and its obvious he loves what he does. Quizzes are easy.
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,This guy loves what he teaches and that makes all the difference in a lecture! Passionate and informative.
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Runtz's lecture style is the most entertaining, engaging, and genuinely hilarious that I have come across so far. You definitely do need to study hard for his tests, but he makes the content very accessible and learning what you need to know is not difficult at all. "
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Excellent Professor. Took this course to satisfy the breadth requirement and boy was I happy I did. I echo what the others have said here, Michael Runtz is energetic, caring and very passionate about the material he teaches. Tons of experience in the field and countless entertaining stories. Highly recommend taking this course."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Runtz is super passionate about the material and makes the lectures very engaging. The tests are very straight forward and easy to complete. The only thing I wasn't fond of was that the class had no lecture slides, so it was a little difficult to organize notes but overall a very good prof."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1901,"Definitely one of the best profs at Carleton University. Would take his class again just for the knowledge, his humour, and amazing lectures."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"There aren't many notes in his lecture videos. However, if you can summarize what he says and catch the most important points, you shouldn't have many problems. Plus, the lectures are engaging with reference to different pictures of animals that he took in the wild. While I'm normally not a biology fan, this course is a considerable exception."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Great prof, amazing lectures, fun course! Make sure you take notes and do the practice quizzes if they're available -- super helpful resource."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,I literally missed my exam because I slept in and he let me retake it what a top G
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Very passionate about the material and made some funny jokes during the lecture. Very memorization heavy for tests. 
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,A++++++++++++++ class. A++++++++++++++ prof. If you know you know.
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Professor Runtz and his lectures were amazing. Honestly had me considering switching to a biology major because of how fascinating the content was. The exams did require you to know a lot of specific details, however, the way the content was taught was so fun and interactive, which made these details easy to remember. "
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Amazing class is impossible to fail. Just watch the lectures and write notes. IT WILL BOOST YOUR GPA and yes this is a bird course
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"This professor is hands down the most passionate teacher I've ever had, his lectures are engaging and his methods of teaching are inspiring."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"He's one of the best professors, very passionate about the material & almost all slides have pictures he personally took of nature (if you're a visual learner, this course is for you). I used to dislike studying about plants and animals but his classes were so interesting I never got bored & I learned a lot. On top of all that, he's hilarious!"
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Professor Runtz is the most passionate professor at Carleton. He really cares about his profession and respects his students. He always brings in animals (taxidermy) and plants so that we have a hands on experience. DO NOT TEXT IN CLASS! He will not put up with this. It is rude anyway. As long as you pay attention you will pass easily.
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,On par with god on teaching and 100% has the best classes ever of all time. Im disappointed that I wont have him in my next few years. Amazing jokes and youll never be bored in class. Tests exams and midterm are fair as long as you pay attention to class (which you will cause its the best). God tier professor
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"The best prof I ever had. One reason i started loving Biology. Fun lectures, easy to understand. You can do without the readings and textbook is an easy read. Lots of fun pictures in lectures. No much papers/ tests for grading. Knows his stuff and brings in real life experience. Passionate about what he teaches and caring. Choose Dr. Runtz!"
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,michael runtz is the best prof at carleton
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Prof. Runtz is a very good prof in my opinion. He makes lectures which are easy to follow most of the time and has a number of opportunities to contact him, the TA's and to work on assignments. There are a few small quizzes in the course and a final paper with an exam but overall the course was great and the prof was great as well."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,Runtz is the best! I took this course just because he was teaching and it did not disappoint. The lectures are extremely engaging no matter the content and the tests/exams are extremely straight forward if you take good notes and pay attention. 10/10 prof
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Professor Runtz is super passionate and overall an excellent prof. He makes jokes, his photos are great, and he tells stories to connect to the material - just a real standout. To echo someone else's point I also almost switched majors because of this course and BIOL1902. He keeps the class engaged and interested and teaches very effectively."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"This course was good in the sense there were no textbook readings. However the prof does not provide notes or slides so you are basically copying word for word what he says. The exam questions all come from his lecture videos, and the time made it difficult, 25 questions with matching sections in 20 minutes. If you took 1902 you may have an edge. "
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Professor Runtz is my favourite professor at Carleton. He is funny, interesting, and clearly incredibly passionate about natural history. His course provided me with information that I use both within and outside of my academic career. If you attend his lectures and take good notes, you should have no trouble in Professor Runtz's classes."
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,Great prof. like watching a national geographic episode you learn and are entertained.
Carleton University,Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Awesome class, much harder than 1st year natural history."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY131,One of the best professor I have had at u of t. His lectures are easy to follow and his tests are completely reasonable (and should be easy if you studied).
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"My favourite prof so far! Excellent teaching, he explains everything very clearly and answers everyone's questions. Tests are also very fair. Even if you think you do not like physics, take his course and you will change your mind! Plus his sense of humour is adorable"
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,He is well-prepared to class. The lecture is fun and easily understood.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,His lectures and listening to his voice would be the most soothing moments of your university life especially if you like physics. He also curves the test scores up even if the average is in the high 60s.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Great to converse with. Clear, and easy tests!"
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Really good prof. Very kind and accessible out of class. I really enjoyed the simple demos in class instead of simply dumping theory on us and saying ""it works btw"". I really like the approach taken for teaching the class and he is very understanding. Loved Physics with him, I'd definitely consider taking more physics courses with him."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"I would have this guy read me the physics textbook to sleep, he's so soft."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"My favourite prof i had at UofT. Not only is he caring and wants his class to do well but he's also really passionate about what he teaches. Also it is evident that he puts in a lot of effort to help the students since he makes pre-class videos that are extremely useful. If you watch those videos and pay attention in class, you will do well."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"SO caring and wants his students to do well. Really easy to reach outside of class for office hours or even one-on-one help. I'm not a physics-inclined student, but he makes it easy to understand the material and to have fun. Also a hilarious and great guy."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Kind on grades, test questions are just slightly more tricky."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,Awesome prof! It's amazing how he took the effort to care for every student for a class size as big as this. He reviewed questions posted in every online quiz and went through some of them in class. Exam questions were fair and as long as you do the past tests. Definitely one of the best profs I've had!
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,Andrew was the most caring and attentive prof I had first year. He explained topics thoroughly and gave frequent breaks to digest the information. He was always around to help students after class too.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Really great professor, very clear when explaining concepts, always tried to answer any questions we had. Tried to keep his class engaged. Love the pre-class videos he makes. Also, you really see how he tries to make an effort in helping his students. I would really recommend taking any of his classes because he is simply amazing"
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,I love him! he's so nice and makes physics class interesting.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Great prof, demonstrates concepts excellently and provides excellent examples. Would recommend the textbook for further examples and instruction, though not entirely necessary. Practicals are a mixed bag but certainly bearable."
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,Very helpful out of class and in class. Pre-class videos were concise and helped a lot.  His demo's were interesting. He even took us students out for lunch!
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Absolutely the best prof I've ever had at U of T. His pre-class videos and super helpful, he's always willing to meet with students outside of class for further clarification on the material, and he explains concepts in an easy to understand way. He's amazing!"
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,He's cool. I like him. 10/10.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Loved this class. I was hesitant to take this class but when i found out that Andrew was the prof it was a no-brainer. I honestly loved this class it was my favourite class that i took in second year. He actually cares about his class and in order to make the lectures fun he takes break and puts up fun slides. One of the best and most caring profs
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,The best beast
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Probably best professor in UofT. Best quantum mechanics I've ever had.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Really a nice professor and he had great lectures. Pre-class videos made the course easier and more accessible
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Most effort I've ever seen a prof put into a course. Very good.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Very helpful and approachable. Always makes himself available to you. Cares a lot about being a good instructor and it shows.
University Of Toronto,Andrew Meyertholen,PHYS2B,"Great Professor, great sense of humor. As a person who has always been scared to take physics, this class was interesting and fun. Yes some quizzes were difficult, but I think it is fair for the most part. I just wish he would give more credit to homework."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL271,"Readings were dense, but his powerpoints outlined them extremely well. However, he'd focus on one point/example for an extended period of time which resulted in rushing the rest of the lecture in the last 5-10 minutes and, he read directly from the slides with barely any additional information. Assignment expectations were clear and fair."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL271,"Professor Wald was great! Super approachable outside of class, and definitely willing to go out of his way to meet with you and make sure you understand the concepts. Assignments required meticulous preparation though."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL271,Grading criteria were always extremely unclear. Concepts were hardly discussed with greater detail than what was written on the slides posted.
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL271,"Class has so much offer, but lacks explanation for key understanding. There is a lot of reading and do it yourself, and therefore causes a lot of confusion. Would probably take this course again with a different professor that does not read off the slides majority of the time and rants on one specific example and then tries to rush at the end."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL271,In PHL271 he attempts to use the Socratic Questioning method- uneffectively. He just comes off as annoying. I understand why the Greeks sentenced Socrates.
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL281,"The professor himself is fine, teaching methods are terrible. Doesn't explain concepts clearly and expects you to just know it. Lack of communication means TAs have different expectations, making it very difficult to score well on essays. Grading rubrics are useless as it is assessed holistically and categories are assigned marks to fit the grade."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL281,"Constantly says ""you know"" while explaining concepts, as if we already knew the concept. Instructions & rubric for papers EXTREMELY unclear, marking by TAs harsh & unfair. TAs & prof had diff expectations & would often give conflicting instructions. No communication w/ students when things went online for COVID. Took 3wks to return grades."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL281,"I found if you did all the readings & took notes, and were paying attention during lectures, you would pass. I found the TA/tutorial instructor to be an overly-anal grader, who could have gone a bit easier when docking marks. Prof Wald read off the slides so it wasn't necessary to attend lectures. Very reading heavy, but interesting. He is kind."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL344,"Professor Wald is seriously one of the most caring professors ever! An angel in disguise on this earth. He's super understanding, and the content of the course, while tough to understand sometimes, is made more clear by him"
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL380,"Great professor, had two classes with him and both were fantastically interesting. His classes are definitely not bird courses, but they're not unfair either. Very funny, very open minded, loves discussing with the class. I think he's definitely in my top 3 favourite teachers at U of T."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL380,"Loved Ben. Funny and entertaining lectures, a really kind and approachable instructor. Not a speck of arrogance."
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL380,Great lecturer! Really helped my understand concepts in the course.
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL380,"Nice guy, approachable, really great insights into material. Would take again!"
University Of Toronto,Benjamin Wald,PHL395,"Extremely harsh marker, doesn't really explain concepts well in class. Not recommend for anyone who hasn't taken that many philosophy classes."
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,APM346,This is his first time teaching this course. He normally goes really fast and many people in the lectures are lost and can't copy what he wrote quick enough. What he needs to do is to explain better. Also he tends to go off on tangents during office hours when you ask him to solve something simple so make sure to yell at him to stay on course.
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,APM346,"i do not even know how such a loser gets into uoft !!!! worst professor i have ever had for my years in this university across all subjects. no explains or guidance was given over the semester. and he assumes everyone in PDE has a physics are majored in physics, which is ridiculous!!! he surely does not know how to teach and how to learn !!!"
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,APM346,"He doesnt explain any concepts at all or try to let you learn something from lecture but just read off, and the final exam is much harder than term tests. Past exams from other profs are completely different from his. So hurt after seeing the final grade:("
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,APM346,Worse prof ever... read notes without explain. Test concept never taught.
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,APM346,"i cannot believe that UofT let him to teach a third year course. he is a true note reader. his lectures are super boring. he provides no explanations and no insights whatsoever, just read and copy through the textbook. no students understand the course materials unless they learned similar materials in physics classes. he gave hard test questions."
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,MAT244,Good lecturer given the amount of content required to teach. You can tell he takes alot of effort to teach us well. The material is quite difficult to follow without doing pre-class readings. He follows the book closely. I would've liked to see solved examples outside the book (since I can always refer to the book when needed). But good overall!
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,MAT244,"I dont understand what a lot of the other students here are talking about. I've taken him in the first semester of 2019, by far the best MAT244 tutor. He follows the textbook closely, and the pace of his lectures are on par with what the course requires. He might have improved alot this semester, im not sure. I'd be happy to take his course again."
University Of Toronto,Richard Derryberry,MAT244,"Really fast. He clearly has no idea what level students are at (for instance casually doing partial derivatives w/ no explanation, which few students have ever seen before). Writes endless notes with little/no explanation. Class is a total waste of time."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,MAT302,"Just never wanna see her again in my life, worst prof ever"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,SAT257,Worst prof I had at U of T. DO NOT CHOOSE Katherine for STA257!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!!!
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA220,"Very difficult. DO not take with her. Made me hate anything to do with stats and. Did not teach well, lectures were only a summary of modules and did not solve questions that were reflective of the difficulty of the tests."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA220,"Textbook not mandatory, but you'll need it to prepare for her brutal tests. The lecture material will *not* prepare you for tests - don't like the assignments fool you. Need to ask a question? Don't expect any good responses from Piazza, where she only offers one line answers and sometimes with condescending language."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA220,Course was extremely disorganized. Students required to self teach through posted videos and clarify trouble topics in class. This was extremely overwhelming and midterm was tough. The final (all MC and TorF) was even worse than the midterm. The course was also not curved in any way. Professor was pretty good but course evaluations horrible.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA220,"Because this was a flipped course she struggled a bit with organization, but when you ask her questions she is extremely helpful!! She is super friendly and really cares about her students! She made her questions very fair if you actually studied and paid attention in class. Great prof overall!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA221,Not too bad... very nice and responsive. Her tests are a bit hard but the assignments are extremely easy.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA221,"The single biggest thing is her lack of empathy and communication skills with students. She leaves passive-aggressive comments and short answers on Piazza. She blames students whenever there's an opportunity to. She plays the victim when students need help. Instead of taking the time to listen and consider concerns, she deflects. It's pitiful"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA221,this prof is the laziest thing I've ever met. Honestly she should go back to how-to-become-a-professor school. I'd personally like to thank the textbook for my success in this class.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA221,"The professor is juts reading her slides, so it is boring. However, you need to go to class just to have participation mark. This class would have been done in 2h, totally unuseful blablabla from the teacher... I do not recommend at all."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"She is a ppt reader, totally waste of time to attend her lecture. Always made mistakes in quizzes, quite rude to students. Worst professor I have ever seen."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Her question is so strange. I understand every word in her question but I dont understand the question. Her ppt content is very simple but the exam content is very complicated
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Taking this course is the worst experience in uni and I received the worst grade that I have ever got with no surprise. This is the only course I feel like hard-working gains nothing in the end.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"This course really require a lot of efforts. I would say the quality of the pre-recorded videos is high. Her lectures are pretty detailed and very helpful for quizzes and exams. I really enjoy learning new statistics knowledges in her class. (The participation requirement is a bit annoying, especially for people living in other time zone like me. )"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,All of her test questions are extremely ambiguous. She takes forever to mark the tests and takes a long time to respond. Has double-standards.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Test questions are pretty hard.......
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I would be lying if I said I had a remotely fruitful or engaging learning experience from STA257. Quizzes were clearly worded with the sole intention to spark confusion, lectures were simply a regurgitation of the slides and the overall class environment was one in which any wrongdoing could only be on the part of students and not Prof Daignault."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Just don't take this if STA257 is not mandatory. The pre-lecture videos are just reading slides and the lecture is mostly-repeating slides -- but in a faster way. If you do need to take STA257, I recommend you to take the summer section. Tests are really hard compared to what she teaches. Quizzes are time-intensive and need lots of work. GPA killer"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Everything she does comes from a good place, and the lectures are quite good, but ""overkill"" might be the most appropriate word to describe how the course is coordinated. Have that being said, the course overall is NOT hard, and here is the most important part: I started STA257 loving stats, and I finished STA257 still loving stats."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Her final redefines hell, thats all Im going to say"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Why would she not correct the slides in a PRE-RECORDED lecture!? How lazy can one be? Also why would she not post the annotated slides after the lecture is done!? These are just basic things she could improve on apart from the inaccessibility and mediocre lectures. The slides are all empty when you want to review for the exam to cross-check.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Worst prof ever. The assignment is to make multiple choices for her future use.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,She clearly put a lot of effort into the class and seemed to care a lot. I personally found the forced attendance and the participation marks annoying(which didn't even have a clear marking criteria until very late into the course). Just leaving this here incase all the reviews from before are scaring you from taking the course with her.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Had such a traumatic experience in STA257, I really wish I had listened to what rate my professor and raddit posts said about her... Run as far as you can"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"The median for the test was 52. This isn't a measure of the students' competency, but solely a reflection of prof. Daignault's absolutely pathetic teaching style. I hope you're not compelled to take her as I was. My sincere condolences to her future employers."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Worst prof I had at uoft as a math specialist. Both bad at explaining and testing Most disrespectful thing is giving us an assignment where we literally just make more multiple choice questions for her to use for her next year class, like seriously why do we have to design your course for you just because you, as a TEACHING STREAM professor, cbf to"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Avoid her if possible, worst prof I've had in uoft. Lectures are useless, reads completely off of her slides. Weekly quizzes are weirdly worded. She simply doesn't care about students."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Her lecture is literally just reading from the slides, will not admit her mistakes during the lecture, and definitely does not know how to write proof rigorously. She will not answer the students' questions and literally ignore our questions. Tests are way harder than questions in lecture. DO NOT TAKE HER!!!!!!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,I gave 1.0 because apparently RMP does not allow me to give 0 or below. Tests are difficult while lectures are useless.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I was actually looking forward to this course but Katherine absolutely ruined it. Why would someone teach stats if they're clearly not interested in the students' learning process?? The probability of you enjoying the lectures is 0. Just read the slides rather than watching the long, boring videos, as that's basically what she's doing."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Reviewing for the test is useless. Prepare to die.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Extremely difficult test, easy examples in class. Well done, Katherine!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Overall an odd prof.. Lectures are clearly done while reading from a script. On many occasions she'd repeat herself without realizing it. Didn't allow mic access during office hours.. Overall lectures are kind of boring and not very engaging. She's nice enough, and tests are graded somewhat leniently, but I just didn't feel like she's engaging."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I love statistics, but this course feels more like a chore than a learning experience. The only reason to attend lecture is to get the participation mark and do the unnecessary quiz at the end. There is heavy pre lecture prep and needless synchronous lectures with little value to add to the independent prep. The lectures are boring and repetitive."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Don't take her
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Recommend her to take CSC165 first. Always write proof informal.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"To be honest, her lecture is fine, but the quizzes are sucked, when she wrote the quiz, only Gods and her know what the hell is she doing, and now, only gods know. Her quizzes always appear with some ambiguous options. I wouldn't take this class If it weren't the necessary crouse for my program, and I will Never ever choose her class again."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Lazy. We have to watch close to 1-2 hours of videos before class and then she goes over everything in a hurry. Does not often explain the intuition behind certain statistical theories. Her course is poorly designed.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I dont know why everyone is so harsh on her, shes being sweet and as a newer prof shes doing well!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,She deserves a 5/5 from me because she accepted my last submitted term test:)
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I think the previous posts say it all but, in general, not a very good prof. She teaches fairly decent but the logistics and outside of class aspect is what weight the most. In my opinion, she just doesn't seem like she is prepared to deal with the students, and usually her quizzes/tests are unrenamable in terms of time and content."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I will repeat three times: avoid her, avoid her, avoid her!!!!!!!! If you don't want to have mental health problems or having a headache every single day."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"She never answer emails, The length of preparation is the same as lecture hour"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Insensitive comments when responding to students. Refuses to listen to students needs and does not troubleshoot. Blames students for her own mistakes. Condescending tone and passive aggressive comments. Numerous errors on quiz and yet does not admit her mistakes. Honestly just fix them and move on.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Katherine is amazing. Stats department teaching staffs can often be unclear and disorganized, but Katherine teaches very well, and makes difficult concepts straightforward, even when it is a tough course and it is very easy to teach badly."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Extremely hard test. Test materials are not really related to the courses, it is much much harder."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Worst prof. At the beginning of term when the class really disliked her I kind of felt bad, but by the end of term I also can't stand her anymore. Slide reader, lots of typos, cannot answer questions asked in class, unreasonable exams. I learned more from my tutorial TA.. However, could not avoid because there's only one session of this class..."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I cant say she is a teacher... Many typos in the slides and she even cant do calculation correctly. I have never thought math and sat be that hard. Though I got A+ in the end, I still dont like her lectures. I have done all the practice she assigned in the textbook, but the coefficient of correlation between practice and exam is 0:)"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I got an A, but she is the worst prof I have ever had. I never go to the lecture, but I think that is the reason why I can get an A."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Absolutely horrible. Lectures were meaningless and the final was much harder than the usual course materials. She fits nicely in the horrible stats department at UofT.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Bad lecture, slides reader. And refuse to help. Worst prof Ive seen ever. I got A in all other second year course except for this one. Her final exam is soooooooooo hard, and not related to what she talk about in lectures."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I think she was helpful and has potential. However, by the end of the course (the final quiz and exam), the level of difficulty of the homework, in class examples, etc was absolutely nothing like the exam... leading to most of us having panic attacks on the way out. If she can recalibrate that she'll be a good prof in my opinion."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Too many typos in her slides. The final was extremely difficult; even doing every question in the textbook was of little help.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"The difficulty does not match her quality of teaching. 1.) 6/12 weeks, she has made a typo. Not corrected. With the exception of one time. 2.) The overall attitude, philosophy, environment, organization, of the class is not good. She admitted that she makes awkward typos about 3 times but there is no change 3.) I got no more char left, it goes on"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,dont take it. u'll regret it forever. The final exam is way harder than the materials we leaarnt throughout the term (and the past papers taht were given to us). I knew im going to fail the minute i see the question. I did every single question in the textbook but still got totally lost while writing the final.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Choose Katherine if you want fail this course. The final exam is too hard, not matching what she taught in the class. It's like a final exam for graduate students. She did not teach you anything in the lectures(slides is literally copy paste from the textbook and still have lots of typos)and expect you just know yourself. It's ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,super hard final. Choose her if you want to fail the course
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"The worst prof I have seen at UofT, or I should not say she is a prof or a teacher. She does not keen on this course at all. Always make tons of mistakes in every weeks lecture I even do not know how could she make it. I really enjoy studying math and statistics but I cannot get any happiness in her course. Do not take her class!!!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"During lecture, all she did was copy notes from the textbook (with lots of errors) and recited them to us without explanation. In the night section, she would often rush through content so that she could leave early (class went until 10). The questions on the final were not at all like what we saw in class, on quizzes, or in the textbook."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I probably gonna fail STA257, she is rediculous. Failing people for fun"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"First of all this was not very mathematically rigorously taught, more like we had to develop the intuition and learn the material on our own as the lectures were just a carbon copy of the textbook. Exam did not appropriately test on the material that we learned throughout the course and was not fair at all, regardless if you did the ALL problems."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Not a great lecturer and tests were definitely very difficult for a sta257 class but I did enjoy the new (and advanced) problems she threw at us.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Lectures are a waste of time. Skipping class and reading the textbook in a library is a better use of time. I dont know how she manages to copy and paste the textbook and do it wrong every week. Every time someone called her out she kind of evaded the question. I attended both evening and night lectures and she rushes through night ones to go home
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Her slides are copy and pasted from the textbook and she doesn't expand on concepts in lectures, making them useless. Even one on one I find that she is not confident in her explanations or isn't clear. As a new prof this is expected but it's unforgivable when she gives us a final with none of the material she has prepared us with."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"WORST course ever, what kind of professor reads texts from slides that's directly copied from the textbook? WORD-BY-WORD COPYING... If we could just read the textbook, why would we still need you? She gave the MOST difficult final exam I have ever taken, didn't have a clue what's being tested... DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS, LIKE EVER!!!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,That final was the hardest test Ive taken in my life despite feeling prepared from doing past tests. In danger of failing the course now.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,She is unenthusiastic about teaching and does not prioritize students. Basically told us in the last lecture that this class is not her priority because she needs to study for her own phD finals. Lecture is boring and confusing. The midterm paper was the same for Monday and Wednesday's section so Wednesday got higher and she didn't care.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Lectures consisted of her reading off her slides which were primarily copy pasted from the textbook. The first few tests were reasonable. Midterm was hard but fair, but the final did not represent what was covered in the course and seemed solley created to test students recall of specific integration tricks shown in lecture and the like."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I like the course content, and I actually dont mind the fact that she threw in some higher level stuff in this 2nd year course. But I have to say, her lectures are not helpful at all. I can just sit home and read the slides or the textbook, and understand things just as well, if not better."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"The final was far from the content she taught in the lecture, but weighed for 50% (or 70% of the course grade. The wording and question form were totally different. She literally read off the slides, which are copies from the text book. No emphasis for key points, no solutions for quizzes, and nothing learnt actually from her."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Katherine is not too bad, but she could do better. The last quiz did test on the most two difficult chapters of this course, but it's basically the same as questions on her slides, be prepared! Final is difficult, really tests on if you could understand the situation,think Intuition behind formulas and apply statistical tools properly and quickly."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Definitely the worst professor I've ever met in uoft. Good job reading from slides without explanation. Made mistakes in EVERY LECTURE. Covered knowledge from third year and even fourth year statistics courses in a second year course. Exam was not representative for course material.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Exam was not representative of course material or preparation questions. She reads off the slides and does proofs poorly.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I literally did all the assignments, past tests and even lots of extra problems on the back of the book but nothing helps the exam lol"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Hardest test I've ever had
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Same midterm for two class in different days. She said it was absolutely fair. Super hard final, you cant understand what the question is asking. Nothing was covered in class or book."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Such an difficult exam. Barely understands the problems. Quiz 4 HARD as well. Study for past tests and exercise are not helping.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,So bad teaching and so hard test!
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,the exam was soooooo hard
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Terrible Avoid at all cost, just read the textbook. Has a condensing attitude."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Take her lecture if you want to fail. My CGPA is currently 4.0 and I think it will change because of this course. I haven't ever found statistics that hard. Even though her slides are not too bad, there are countless typos and she cannot even fix her mistakes during the lecture. If you have to take courses taught by her, good luck."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Repeating the slides is what she usually does in class, which is kinda useless. She also has tons of typos and wrong answers on her slides, most of the time she could not correct herself and instead ask us to figure out later. She gave two different sections the similar tests for midterms, but the test time was on different days."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I've got to say that her lecture is totally useless as well as her office hour. She always gave vague answers and explanation in class and refuse to clear them. Also, she made tons of mistakes in simple calculations which is rarely seen in such a stats course. All in all, she messed up this fascinating course."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"She always made mistakes and give the same tests for two sections in Monday and Wednesday. For unclear questions, she always refuses to answer it. Also, she is not even close to nice during her office hour. I've been there once and I swear I will never go again. She really messed up this attracting course. Anyway, she is really nc."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I do not like her. As statistics prof., she even made simple mistakes in simple calculus. In her lecture, she just read slides and did nothing."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"She doesn't understand statistics well and what she is doing is only reading the slides. This course is useful regarding the knowledge, whereas my experience is really bad."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Nice person, bad prof. No point in going to lectures she just reads off the slides"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,I found her lectures clear and very helpful for understanding. The midterm was fair and I got an A and quarter of the class did as well.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Lecture is a waste of time and test questions are unfair. She made the exact same questions for both sections while the tests were scheduled two days apart. During the test she refuses to clarify ambiguous questions. Avoid her if you can
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,"She is the worst professor I've ever met. In lecture, she just read through the book as well as slides and do some proofs or calculations. Also, she got two term test with 95% similarity for different test section. The later section can easily get the answer from the former one and have 2 more days for preparing. That's ridiculous."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,I had her for STA257. Lectures were good.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257,Just read txtbook. Her lectures are pointless unless you want to know how to do the exercises on the slides. My highschool data management teacher teaches better than her.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA257H1F,"Unintelligible lectures, tricky quizzes, annoying marked group discussion."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Prof. Katherine was a fair instructor, organized, clear lectures & provided leniency with 2 no-questions asked extensions for students. Midterm exam was difficult, so prepare well. Assignments & multi-part final project were manageable. Many complain, but she's responsive on question boards & everything balanced, overall good prof for this course!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Strict criteria and non-sensical grading expectations baffled me. While the course is relatively straightforward, she cannot communicate her ideas. She is easily offended, and questions are taken as criticism taking up a defensive tone as though we're attacking her character. The course isn't comprehensive, and when asked questions, she's vague."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Katherine is an okay lecturer, she explains the concepts clearly. The midterm was fair. A big complaint that I have is about the marking scheme and the structure of the final. The marking scheme is too strict, and while you might feel you met everything, you'll still be penalized. The final project felt too restrictive and not flexible enough."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Difficult test & projects, strict grading scheme"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"If STA302 is your requisite course, AVOID this professor. Please consider taking the course in winter or summer term with other professors. "
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,She is the most awful and most disrespectful prof I have ever seennnnnn. Taking her course is the worst choice I have ever made
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"worst prof ever seen, donnnnnnnnnn't choose this ***. I am so regretful taking her course. it would be the nightmare of my whole life"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,The most awful professor I have ever seen. Unreasonable marks on projects (She did not even tell us what we should do clearly). 
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I saw a lot of negative views about her. Of course, she had a crazy amount of homework needed to do, I got about a 45percent before the grades come out, and finally, I got a huge curve up. She will torture you when you take the course, but she also will give you a huge curve when you done the course. Her teaching was clear, not good not bad. "
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Awful! Avoid at all costs. Does not care much about students. Grading expectations are unclear. 
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Avoid her if you can.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Grading is all over the place.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,The grading in this course are very inconsistent. She's also terrible at teaching. TAs are also just as incompetent as her!!!
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Never take a class with her.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Way too many assessments 
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Too many assignments to complete (1-5% each) that requires at least a week of work for each + weekly quizzes that are almost impossible to do. 
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,This professor is by far one of the toughest at UofT. Her tests are very difficult and the rubric for her assignments (which are long and pointless) are unforgiving to any mistakes whatsoever. Avoid this professor if possible as this is the hardest course I've taken at UofT.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Too many meaningless but lengthy assessments. Marking is inconsistent
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Waste your time!!
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She has absolutely no empathy. I was in hospital and wasn't even given an extension on the midterm. Lectures are completely useless, she just reads off her slides. At least 2 assessments each week, some of them have no takeaways but only to waste your time. She also gives assessments that are due on Sunday and during reading week."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Literally the most difficult course I ever took in UofT. Quizzes are insanely hard and lectures do not help at all. Course is filled with thousands of ridiculous graded discussions and assignments. The time commitment required to marginally do good in this course is extremely high. Don't take this course with Prof Katherine and yourself a favour.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Unpopular opinion but I think she is not even that bad. I actually learned a lot about data analysis through her 3-part assignments and I didn't think they were that hard, you just have to read the marking scheme carefully. Plus she does curve a lot at the end (course avg is a B-, despite the midterm avg being around 50)."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Professor Katherine Daignault is not as bad as I thought. She is really caring and always being so kind. Her midterm and quizzes are hard but the workload is not heavy at all.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Too many assignments that are packed close to each other. Grading was late making impossible to drop course or CR/NCR before deadline. Only took bc it was a mandatory course. Terrible experience. While prof tries to be nice, way too high requirements. Long assignments and will nitpick. Terrible midterm average and will only ""consider"" curving."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Usually never bother to leave reviews but this prof was absolutely horrendous. Worst prof in my entire undergrad, has no respect or empathy and gives 0 f about students and accommodating accessibilities. Horrible human being, I thought I knew what I was going into taking a course with her but holy I was so wrong. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Overwhelming slides every week, disorganized lectures and overall course structure. Arbitrary grader. Honestly, the content shouldn't even be that difficult - she just makes it extremely hard to piece everything together so, in the end, your understanding is filled with gaps. Even if you grind at her class, there's a good chance you'll fail. F her."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Can you believe that she does not allow statistics students to find datasets from Kaggle, UCL machine learning, etc? I have to spend days finding a dataset that satisfies her requirements."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She doesn't respect our efforts: 1. just reading slides during lecture time without any explanation. 2. Test and assignment marks are very random, answers write in two pages, she will not check the second page, just give 0 based on the first page. 3. most assignment is useless, test your writing skills, not statistic skills."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,She has absolutely no sympathy. Takes every suggestion as personal attack. Lectures are basically reading slides and tests are hard. Avoid her if you need the grades
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Sooooooo many assignments and tests and projects! And we have a midterm that avg is below 60
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Just dropping here that if we can have a course where the class average for the midterm isn't significantly below 50 for all sections, that would be great thanks."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She's a nice, reachable and passionate teacher. However, the course is so work heavy. We have weekly quizzes, in class labs, discussions, midterm, video project, written exercises and final project with multiple parts. She assigned too much work that her team couldn't even manage to mark them."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I had to create an account on this website just to express how bad of a prof she is. She packs the lectures with way too much content and gives way too much work. Lots of memorization with little intuitive explanations, so it's extremely difficult to actually get a conceptual understanding. I've had bad profs before, but this is incomparable."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She successfully makes learning statistics boring and difficult, literally read from slides, and all the example questions are like ""1+12"" but the midterm questions are like ""Please solve Russell's paradox""."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Although this is a statistics course, KD is good at writing super long slides with text all over it. Prepare to read her fking long slides and around 1.5-2 hours of pre-lecture videos"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I hate her. Taking 302 with her in the fall rn, we have discussions, in-class labs, tests, a plethora of exercises and assignments split into many parts, and a final project. I don't get why she's making this course so work-heavy. I spend more time on her 3 part assignments than I do on actual important courses, and all that for 5-10% each."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Good lecture videos and relatively understandable assignments, but a brutal midterm under intense time constraints with most questions found nowhere in the lectures."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"The midterm for her online course was killer. Unlike any other midterm she or any stats prof has ever written. Her questions are weirdly written and the formulas written were not stuff she taught in class. There were 3 assignments, 1 midterm, 2 ""mini-projects"" (one being a bs recorded presentation), and one final project. So much work!!!"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I mean her lectures and Mini Projects are just fine, but the tests are just terrible. The questions are just completely unrelated to the stuff she covered in lectures and everything u reviewed is just useless. I never expect I'm managed to fail the first course in university, the last semester before graduation."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I took this course in the summer of 2020, it was amazingly well taught. The lectures really went into depth and were the best formatted statistics lectures I've had so far. Quizzes were extremely fair and the mini projects were a great mark booster if you kept up with the course content. There was also (free) marks for posting discussion questions."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,The course was very organized. Great lectures and she provides neat notes. The quizzes were extremely difficult but as long as you studied hard you shouldn't do too bad.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,AVOID AVOID AVOID! Worst prof. Unempathetic. Ignores students' needs and accommodations. She adds ridiculous rules to fail people.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Really bad professor, doesn't know how to teach, doesn't care about teaching AND HAS REALLY TOUGH UNRELATED TESTS!!! Do not take her courses if you can. You will save your mental health."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I missed a midterm because I was hospitalized for 3 weeks. It was impossible to submit a verification of illness(VOI) within a week. When I finally submitted it, she didn't accept it and said I didn't provide evidence of hospitalization. This was during the covid-19 pandemic, and this was my only course to graduate school. Screwed my job and life"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Online quiz extremely difficult. Never give enough time. Lecture sucks.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Her slides are detailed and straight-forward. I felt that she was pretty helpful in office hours as well. Really like how her assignments are made because it tests your knowledge and application of the concepts learned in class. Her midterm was really hard though (not enough time). COVID-19 changed the marking scheme to heavily weight assignments.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I really like her, I took her STA257 as well. The learninng experience with her in STA302 is amazing, she lay emphasis on how to use your knowledge and do analysis instead of just do the questions. And she responds emails and piazza detailed. If you really want to learn stats, don't skip classes and do assignments, they strengthen your knowledge."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Everything is hard and ambiguous. Slides are wordy and much of words are useless, hard exams, ambiguous problems on assignments and exams, just read slides during lecture, low midterm grades (42%) and the curve can be neglected, plus full of typos on everything. The worst prof I've met. Just avoid her if you can."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,40% midterm average lots of assignments hard coding dont take it
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,tooooooo hard for sta302 students
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"kat has a great personality but that doesnt change the fact that she gives very difficult tests yet she always expects us to do well. i mean, can she try our shoes? like the class avg is always 50% or 40%, doesnt this say enough???? hope she knows how to set up a good test in the future."
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,"lots of typos, lots of assignments, slides reader"
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA302,Assignment is hard. Read slides. I have 5 midterms at the same date and I ask for change to other section to write the midterm. But she didnt allowed. No nice at all.
University Of Toronto,Katherine Daignault,STA304,"Midterm average below passing grade says a lot. Plus she only curved up to 50, the minimum grade required to pass. TOO MANY MISTAKES IN SLIDES. I think teachers should know to self-reflect and try to improve when only less than 10% of the students enrolled show up to class, especially while attendance counts for marks."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"At first, her lecs were very hard to understand & she spoke too fast, but as the sem went on, she spoke slower and explained better (though not good). You need to take notes of EVERY little thing she mentions bc its testable. Pay attention to the pics and the tiny words on the pics. The assgmt was a mark booster but u need to work for it. not easy"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Geniunely a nice person, but the first midterm was definitely rough (52% average IIRC). Second midterm was a breeze, assignment was marked leniently, and final exam was extremely fairly. Her lectures are actually taught very well, and she's super nice in office hours. A tough and challenging course, but doable nonetheless."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Don't get scared away by your midterm marks. The assignment and final definitely boosted my mark. Attend office hours and post questions on discussion boards, they help a lot. 
Attempt the tutorial questions before the TA goes over them, make the best use of the limited practice questions!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"You can at least get an easy A if you know everything in ppt. The average for assignments is pretty high, and the LEC content is very useful for every life science student."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I changed my whole major because of this class because the prof was just bad. the content was doable and its biochem so obviously its tuff but she made it IMPOSSIBLE. I hope she understands how detrimental this is for her students. I want to confront her and tell her she made my dislike myself over a STUPID COURSE. I feel for future uoft lifesci 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Please Uoft, my mental health is already messed up and you decided to bring patterson to screw me up harder. She is bad, really bad at this. I am sure the content was not that bad BUT MAN she hates us. she is just bad. I hope i can mentally recover from her class cause I don't think I WILL EVER"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Please run, if you cant, speed walk AWAY FROM THE PATTERSON. She made me hate biochem. I actually enjoyed all the bio courses, even the tough ones BUT SHE WAS AWFUL. you can tell she took pride in failing her students. I really hope someone else teaches the BCH210 class. She should not be a prof. If I ever teach, I will make sure to not be her"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"As the person responsible for all our tests, yikes. As a lecturer and course coordinator, I've actually found that she's really nice and accessible in person. BCH210 will hit you like a freight train at first, but the final assignment was marked VERY leniently and the final was definitely curved up. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Patterson is a good lecturer I learned a lot about biochemistry. BCH210 would benefit from not focusing on the minutiae of lab techniques, any lab a student joins would cover procedure and we wont remember all the details without application in the lab. Less concise slides and good practice materials would improve BCH210."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,This course does not provide any textbook along with bare minimum lectures. The exams are not reflective of the lecture material (despite being told it's only lecture-based). The saving grace of BCH210 was the TAs. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Got 88 , I think this course is ok."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She thought she ate but she left crumbs. She needs help cause she really thought we were phd level students. Even if you know the materials inside out, she makes sure to pull the weirdest questions. Not organized and does not go over order of slides. Very passive aggressive in discussion. Please be ready to be railed harder than 1st year Chem. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"As long as you try to learn the material and rely less on a coddling prof and more on your own study methods and learning, you should be golden! The slides are not as detailed as lectures. For me, I found that not going in person and watching the lectures online helped a ton in learning. Give her a chance! Plus, she gives out candy sometimes. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Challenging course. Requires lots of time and effort to solidify understanding (I spent ~1-3h studying after each lecture). Her lectures are clear and concise. Every word and every sentence on her slides are testable, so make sure you fully understand them. Assignments were marked fairly and leniently. Overall, this course is worth studying."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"In retrospect, it was a decent class, albeit harder comparatively to other life science courses, which is why most people leave negative reviews. Weekly quizzes are easy to do good on, but hard to get perfect. Midterms are the toughest part of this course. Writing assignment was marked very leniently, and the final was extremely fair."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She's a great teacher and is very knowledgeable about biochemistry. The test questions can be challenging. However, as long as you prepare well, it's very possible to get good marks on her tests. There are lots of ways to get marks in the course, which is awesome. She and a TA answer every single question on the discussion boards which is amazing!!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Professor Patterson is a very good lecturer and easy to follow, organized, and I actually really enjoyed the material! That being said... her tests were very difficult. Not at all intuitive and the multiple choice had me debating different answers that could be argued to be true. She was also not very helpful with the assignment."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Dr. Patterson is a good lecturer; her slides are easy to understand and she explains concepts quite well. However, BCH210 is an INCREDIBLY content heavy course and the tests are very difficult. On tests, there are trick questions that require you to carefully read every word of the question because it is trying to lead you to the wrong answer. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"she's nice in office hours. she's a bit over hated but a lot of hate is within reason. her tests are not at all reflective of the lectures taught in class, and she's not a good enough lecturer to be making the test questions so difficult. this course is not easy, but majority of us required it and had no choice. farewell passive aggressive queen "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Going to write her final today. FML
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"BCH with Patterson is the worst course I have ever taken. The tests are absurdly difficult and the averages are very low. She explains concepts in a very confusing manner, makes useless annotations, and somehow expects you to know every single detail inside and out. She also is unable to pace herself during lectures and often rushes the material."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,No. Just no.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Maybe reducing the hardness in the tests would be a great way to earn a good make
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"The Multiple choice Tests had very ambiguous options, I could argue in favor for multiple answers ."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"i think that dr patterson is able to explain the content well and i do leave the lectures with a pretty solid understanding of the material but testing is just not reflective of what is taught. additionally, instructions for the assignment were vague and despite following everything on the rubric, i was marked low."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"the class is hard because biochem is hard, but Patterson is a pretty good lecturer. sometimes better at explaining concepts in office hours. tutorials are optional but extremely helpful. i love her emphasis on biochem and human health"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Like bio130/230, the course should build on the concepts rather than jamming all the pathways into one course. Prof doesn't accommodate anyone even if ill (have proof), has heavy/hard tests/quizzes. Assignment and her teaching sucks, course can be self taught. The protein fanatic knows we suffer,doesn't care & likes to fail u, so much for a ""PhD""  "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her biggest downside is that the tests and quizzes have often different and more challenging content than what she teaches in class. However, she relates a lot of the course back to how u can use biochemistry to make informed health decisions which makes the course a lot more interesting, if u just want a high GPA, this is not the course."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"BRUH. She is ok/good as a lecturer, at least better than some of my other profs. Her tests and quiz questions are just something else. Some questions can be vague and are not objective at all. MC questions ask you which is most important for metabolism, you can provide an argument for all the answers, but the correct one is what she thinks it is. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I don't think she's a bad prof. She's actually a good lecturer, she's super approachable and really nice in office hours, I do think she's better in a smaller setting. That being said, her tests can be BRUTAL. I do think her tests aren't that reflective of the content taught, but biochem is a difficult field and that's not her fault."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Nope. Hope she gets fired for the sake of her future students. Don't want them to go through what everyone else here went through
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,worst course and prof seen in life period
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"if I have to read a research article to answer a quiz based on lectures, it's doomed "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"At the beginning of the semester she was pretty condescending and rude, but as the semester went on I found her to become very understanding and nice, especially in office hours. I'm still screwed for the final lol but at least she makes me giggle sometimes. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Haven't hated a course this much in my whole life
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Guys, read this paper first. ""Metabolism in Motion: Engaging Biochemistry Students with Animation"". Publishing paper like this does not make you a better professor, Patterson. Students need fair tests fit for average or little bit above average, not PHD level tests for undergraduates. I've got 4 textbooks, and I still can't do good in her class. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,For the students that gave her a good rating. You sit on a throne of lies. Do yourself a favor and switch programs. You will be better off. I promise. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Professor Patterson is literally the worst professor because of how inconsiderate she is. Her lectures suck, the exams are a gamble and her responses are so dry. I get that university is a business but what professor wants to see her students fail? If I manage to pass this course, I promise I will start going to church. Amen."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Professor Patterson is not an understanding person AT ALL. She doesn't answer questions in any sort of useful or helpful way, and goes through lectures too quickly. She's not very understanding when it comes to deadlines and extensions either. I didn't really enjoy her course, & having her as a prof made the course much worse than it already was.  "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Please dont take this course/prof if you can help it
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"by far the worst professor and course I have been forced to endure during my time at uoft. Somehow finds a way to make mc tests excruciatingly difficult and hyperspecific on very peripheral information. Expects us to have PHD level knowledge going into a test. Lectures are disorganized, almost feeling like an ensemble of miscellaneous information. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She did not seem that bad at first. This rapidly deteriorated over the course of the semester. Exam questions are hyper-specific, lectures do not feel like adequate preparation, and the assignment has extremely vague instructions. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her lectures are actually okay, I can (at least I think) understand her lectures without needing to rewatch it. 

HOWEVER, her tests are philosophy, or gambling, just not biochemistry. I can confidently say that I can a good student and I work very hard for every course, but your grade for this course is simply not equivalent to your learning."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,The tests and quizzes are unnecessarily difficult. Content isn't that hard but the way the questions are worded results in poor grades. Class averages are very low and you have to work hard to get a decent grade in the course (75-80). If you can take this course with another professor I highly reccommend doing that. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"You come into u of t fresh faced and optimistic. You persevere through the first year of life science. Leaving battered and mentally drained. But you did it you got through the hardest part of university, or so you thought. Because Sian Patterson is the hidden final boss ready to cleave at the remainder of ur gpa with her talons and horns. Be ready"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Professor Patterson is the best thing that has ever happened to me. She is very considerate when it comes to quizzes and other assessments. I aspire to be like her someday, in which I'll be able to give students a very hard time. JK. But for real though, I think she's a good prof but you definitely need to study A LOT to get an A. - Lems"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,she makes my hard work look like a joke when i get the term tests back - she's SO hilarious 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,she inspires me to drop out 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I have never experienced so much stress in a course. Studied a week for the midterms and the results were still horrible. Little to no practice before tests, no textbook, no previous midterms, no outline of tests. You're left to fend for yourself. Random details tested, it's a lottery if you have reviewed it or not."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I'm gonna regret so much in my afterlife if I have a heart attack when releasing grades, or something happens on my way to her lectures. Took this course to have a better understanding of life, not learn to hate it."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Ong I usually just accept and move on from a bad grade. But holy mother of god this class is ass. The content itself is not even that difficult but sian Patterson pulls out questions from the depths of hell with the worst phrasing on her exams. 
If u want to do well in this class start learning gypsy magic or how to perform hexes Cos, not bch"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,yeah no. the other ratings sum up how it feels to be in her class. attendance in con hall decreases for every following lecture she teaches because her lectures are a waste of time and not points of focus on her tests.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,i dont like her classes
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Tests the most obscure details while never focuses on them in lectures. Expects you to pick out the details for tests while lecturing at a pace of 1slide per minute. The answers for her quizzes don't even match with her lectures. Don't understand how she's teaching this course with over a thousand students.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Just bad, all types to bad as you can think. Don't want to waste my time rating her tbh"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I like her a lot. shes super chill and nice. she definitely made tests and quiz's unnecessarily hard but hey that's life.  Study hard and keep up with tutorials and you will do reasonably well.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She tests on obscure details. Be prepared to study at least a week in advance for midterms and finals.
That being said, biochemistry is a hard ass course so you cant really expect it to come easy. Its comparable to mathematics in the sense that even if u have a great lecturer, not everyone will be able to do it."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Sian is not a horrible teacher, nor is she a very good teacher. there are most certainly major faults to how she runs this course, for example her instructions for big assignments are unclear and confusing and she tests u on obscure details - but the upside is she's a caring person, and if u bring questions to her she will do her best to help.
"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Really the worst professor I've had at this school. Lectures are extremely unclear and have absolutely nothing to do with the content tested on the exams, which is reflected in the 59% midterm average. 

The fact that the department still allows her to teach a course that is mandatory for most life science programs is appalling. She is incapable."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Maybe I am not that smart, BUT I shouldn't be insulted by her lectures in this way. You work really hard, and you spend a lot of time on this, then you get a super low grade even she gives everyone two extra credits. I will be having her term test Friday and I am feeling bad now. Her aim is simple: YOU SHOULD ALL FAIL IN BIOCHEMISTRY, period. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Sian is one of the profs at U of T. She is so kind, she shelters the blame for an average of 52%. She has top-of-the-class wording for her questions. It's almost like you are reading a manuscript from Shakespeare. On her tests, she is so thoughtful that she tests topics where she zooms through like Usain Bolt. Her choice of music is top tier."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,i have never hated anyone with such passion
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I bought 3 biochem textbooks for her class, and I think it is a waste of money as her focus is completely not understandable. The writing assignment is extra hard. CHANGE YOUR MAJOR if this course is mandatory. DO NOT TAKE IT! RUN! RUN! RUN! "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"This woman makes me hate everything about biochemistry, so much so that I'm changing my major. Awful term test with a 59% average INCLUDING 2 bonus marks. Quiz and test questions are unrelated to lecture content. Coming to Con Hall at 10 am 3x a week is miserable enough. Thank god for Tyler because tutorials are the only thing keeping me afloat."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,she sounds like a robot. she acts like she is out to get us. I hate her. she does not allow a second for us to write anything down. she skips through the slides so fast. I wish my ta was my prof. he's the only good thing about this course. shoutout tyler 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Patterson is such a bad prof and can't comprehend the fact that people aren't grasping the necessary concepts from her horrible teaching. She doesn't want to help her students, she assigns absurdly difficult assignments with very ambiguous instructions but refuses to answer anyone's questions. Don't take her classes if you can help it."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,No info on the slides but so much information said in the lecutres. The exam questions are really hard and poorly worded. Don't take this course if you don't need it!!
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Patterson does absolutely nothing to help you learn. She sends emails after midterms, stating that there is nothing wrong with the questions, except for the fact that only 3/1250 people received 100. they only received 100 because they were given 2 extra points. She makes you think that if you get hit by a bus tmr, at least you never see her again."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I am sitting in her class rating her, I'd rather read the textbooks I bought but since I paid for tuition its better to sit here even I do nothing. She never have correct pace for lectures and the TA sucks, the term tests will give u questions that you never seen before. Thank you Patterson, you helped me on my way of pursuing fine art!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,she does possess a professional ability to speak of.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"It's not helpful when the midterm average is a 52%. I did well on the MCAT section for biochemistry, yet can't even do well in this class. You have to know every little detail of the course! If you have Patterson for BCH210, run away & hope you can take it w/ someone else. Must take the class again b/c it's a degree requirement. "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Words are not enough to explain the horror
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She stinks
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I don't know how they kept her in this course for so long but clearly there is an issue if the average is 52%
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,horrible prof. horrible class. horrible impact on my GPA. my biggest regret. fml 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She makes every topic very confusing and cannot manage her time efficiently. Her quizzes are designed to make you feel bad for not understanding deep-thinking questions that are not touched on in lectures.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her lecture does nothing but making you more confused. Awful PowerPoints, not helpful at all, not well-organized and makes you confused. Don't know which the important to remember. Annoying weekly quizzes. Anyway, whoever takes this course will cry."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,JUST RUN!!!!!!!!!!!
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She sucks at teaching. You leave each lecture feeling even more confused about the concepts. She made me go to therapy because of how bad her teaching was. The TA's do a better job than her at teaching. Sometimes i wonder how she became a professor
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"It is very quick explaining in the end of the course, I cannot follow very well. There is no clear guiding structure for each lecture."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Awful.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,she is the bane of my existence
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,absolutely the worst. I really strongly dislike. Did not learn anything. She turns into Usain Bolt on the last 5-10 slides of lecture... :(
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I do not like her. My GPA is crying
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,SOooooooooooo Hard!
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Worst prof ever. Has no disregard for anyone but herself. Not accessible, not caring, not considerate. Does not accommodate!! "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I took this class in the summer hoping to avoid this professor as I'd already had to drop it once. No such luck but at least I'm finally done. It seems to me that she is the only prof teaching this course now so I sincerely hope that she reads all this horrible feedback and makes improvements. Dont think she will though. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Agree with the two people below who took this course in Summer 2022. Professor Patterson has definitely taken a complete 180 in terms of teaching attitude compared to previous years. Her lectures are clear and concise, super easy to understand, and tests are fair. Super caring, patient, always willing to answer questions, and replies to emails fast"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Prof Patterson has been an amazing professor throughout the term and made biochemistry actually quite fun. Even though the other comments have poor opinions of her, I personally feel she has taught the course well. The course itself is not easy by any means, so you'll still need to study if you want to succeed."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"This course is definitely hard and requires time and effort. But Prof Patterson is actually super nice. I was scared before starting this course because I read so many awful comments here but I promise I didn't see any of what others claimed (not only my opinion, other people I met in the class all agreed she's great). "
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,unclear lectures and poor explanation of concepts
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,every so often I remember her and  then my whole day is ruined. she made me hate biochem and absolutely wrecked my mental health. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,so so unfair that awful professors are allowed to continue teaching required courses for so many majors and get paid so much. she is so condescending and unhelpful and overall a really bad prof. grading scheme is very convoluted and you can lose so many marks so easily. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Thinks that we should be pros on the content the week that materials are released. Makes you feel bad for getting low quiz marks as if we all have a phd in biochemistry. TAs in the course are lifesavers at least.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I was so busy working in the front line since COVID. I am the health care professional. I asked her extend 3 days for each of my assignment. She needs doctor notes as well as documentation for the college registrar. Does not care about student at all. She is selfish and mean. I dont want to take this course again however I need the letter grade.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Horrible lectures at lightning speed. Tutorials WAY too long, awful quizzes. What the heck is a BBQ????"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Horrible professor, lectures are extremely vague and she is one of the most uncaring narcissistic people I have met."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Fundamental organization problems with this course both with delivery and grading. Lectures were unhelpful and very confusing. I self-learnt all the material by myself and used the lectures as a supplement. The grading disparity unfortunately makes this course prioritizes maintaining an average over student development.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,45% of the class mark consisted of assignments independent of lecture material. Course turned into 3 tumbling research assignments and annoying weekly quizzes. Not very hard to get a high mark in this class if you follow directions and read carefully.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Write down everything she says because you can look it up during quizzes, but use Khan academy and TA tutorials to understand the material because nothing she says makes sense. Also lacks a basic understanding of mental health (told me to stop worrying re my anxiety), and seems annoyed when you go to office hours. Course is fair, but horrible prof."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Lecture slides were horrible and disorganized, the most important things that even showed up on the final were not on the slides, but only briefly mentioned. It was very difficult to understand the content because of this. Also emailed her for help on something and got a one-word response that didn't even answer my question - very unaccommodating."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"honestly? she isn't THAT bad, although i do get why alot of the people here hate on her. personally my biggest issue with her is the fact that she doesn't really put a lot of information on her lectures, and that the tutorials for this class go more in depth which very well may be what she was going for but im still not a fan"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Wasn't a bad lecturer - technically all of the information was available in her slides. In reality, you had to go looking on youtube to get clear explanations. Her assignments were fair as well if you got marked by a TA, but it was clear that she wanted to keep the class average to a certain percentage, and points could be taken off for no reason."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"The professor seems like an amazing person outside of class but her teaching style is so unhelpful. Make sure you absorb every single word she says in lectures for quizzes, and I mean every. single. word. because she will pop the most random questions on there that she may have discussed for about 30 seconds in the whole lecture video."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"WORST professor ever had. Read off the slides. In one sentence, emphasize A and test B just to confuse you. Can't learn for quizzes with her lecture. I heavily depended on TA who was really nice and explained much much better than her. All Really indifferent, while other professors try to help, she ignores our voice of inconvenience she made."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"The more you listen to her explanations, the more confused you get. It sounds more like she's explaining things to herself than explaining things to her students."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Awful marker with no consistency.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,she would not give an extension for anything in the class when i had covid and declared a week-long absence. i was sick for 1/3 of the time the assignment was available and she could not even be bothered to tell me to get well soon. she is rude and curt during office hours and discussion boards offering unhelpful explanations to questions at best.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,The most ridiculous class and the worst lecture experience I have ever had.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"One of the most uncaring and rude professors I have ever encountered; if you need any accomodation regarding assignments/quizzes whatsoever, expect nothing, regardless of your circumstance. Lectures are ridiculously condensed and convoluted and quizzes test things she says in a split second. BCH210 is in dire need of a new couse coordinator."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Her assignments are way too confusing. Asks for the moon yet only gives you a page for details + images which means you'll be running out of space real fast. Marks these assignments for detail yet gives such little space to put those details in.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Dr. Patterson is tough, but her class is very fair. Her lectures could use some work as they were hurried and convoluted at times, but if you pay attention to the tutorial and meticulously follow all grading criteria for the assignments, an A is definitely possible."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Don't interpretate things well and only read slides. A horrible class! She is not here for teach! Do not write down a single words even the content is abstract.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Dr. Patterson is one of the most caring professors I've had so far at U of T. I find that students rate professors based on how well they were able to handle a course, not how well a professor taught them. Dr. Patterson seems so passionate about biochemistry and is so willing to take questions and help you understand the material."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Tries very very hard to screw your grade in the course, dropping it had saved my GPA, take her if you want to have you want to fail the course by her impossible assessments intentionally"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Worst professor ever had
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She is hard marker and wants students to do poorly, she also has a bad attitude towards students when students approach for help. Worst professor ever had. Would never take any course by her again. Avoid her"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Terrible teacher. Quizzes were on the smallest details from lectures blink and you'll miss it type of things. Assignment grades were clearly told to be held to a specific grade. Couldn/t really excel with rng marking and the final. YOu do not see ur mark for the final and some how im supposed to believe the final brough me down 5 %
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Horrible and messy lectures. She never teaches anything relevant for exams making lectures useless to go to. Aher exams are brutal and unfair with 0 curves, tries very hard to screw your mark in the course. Worst professor ever seen. Never ask any questions cuz she uses passive aggresive tone with a disgusted expression on her face. Good riddance"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She only reads slides in class and gives brutal exams. Worst class ever had at u of t
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"This is just unbelievable. Worst attitude ever seen, she waste time in class for nothing.. Midterm averages were very low but the professor decided to give a very brutal final exam and curve everyone down. No adjustments were made to the majority of the class even tho many people did very poorly on final exam. Thank you for ending like this"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Truly the worst professor at uoft. The lectures are hard to follow and all relevant testable information is not on the slides. She failed to properly explain concepts and yet would make the quizzes difficult. The workload was insane: 6 quizzes every week, mandatory tutorial attendance, and biweekly projects. On top of this, she was rude af."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,one of the worst profs i've ever had. clearly disregards student well being and mental health and refuses to admit there is a marking discrepancy between TA's. any regrade request is marked lower by her so avoid asking in the first place. avoid at all costs
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"i don't understand all the hate she's getting, she was an amazing prof when i had her. her lectures were clear and organized. people come to university to get a good education not to get easy work. her class is only easy if you ask questions, review daily, and have a good mindset!!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Lectures were fine, just a bit boring and confusing. The poor TA had to teach us everything during a 2 hour weekly tutorial. Quizzes you on every little detail. Didn't understand why we had lecture AND weekend quizzes. But I really enjoyed the written assignments we had to write and the topics that they were on (way better than tests imo)."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I'm taking BCH210 over the summer of 2021 and honestly it isn't that bad. Prof always makes sure to answer your questions on the discussion boards. Yes, she does seem to focus on tiny details in quizzes and BBQs, but fortunately, it's not worth that much. She likes short, packed, lectures, but is usually clear and concise."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Going into this course, Prof. Sian Patterson's rating really stressed me out, but looking back, I find that taking the course with her was truly a great experience (especially since you can tell she really wanted you to learn - and I did). In order to get an A, focus more on the learning objectives and actually participate in tutorials. Good luck!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Don't take this course. The problem is the TA's. They mark the assignments inconsistently, so if you and a friend have assignments that are very similar, you might get a 10/15 and they get a 14/15. Patterson always sides w/ the TA's and will never acknowledge that they're sabotaging students grades. Your grade is determined by luck, not effort."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her lectures were fine... but if you can, wait until this courses is in-person again! The assignments are super long, and mostly unrelated to anything we learn about in class. Not actually testing your understanding of course material, but just how to write long, useless intros about general knowledge. Quizzes were ok but sometimes ambiguous."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Dooooooooooon't take this class
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,The worst professor I've ever met.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"sian condenses her 3 hour lectures into 20 minute ones, and always tests us on material that she covered for 0.3 seconds and wasnt even on the slides. when emailing her, she can be very rude and dismissive. i heard a student who got covid asked for an extension but she refused. she doesnt care about our mental health, and doesnt show any sympathy."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I honestly liked Dr. Patterson and I'm not sure why others disagree. The workload may be a bit heavier than other courses but I learned a lot from her class. Her lectures are concise and straightforward, though they could be more detailed. Her quizzes and tests were fair. Don't blame her for not studying and doing poorly on assessments."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"As a teacher at a tertiary level institution her demeaner is uncaring, uncompassionate, callous and inconsiderate! I don't understand why the University employs someone of this caliber - not good for kids!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She truly could not care less about you. Petty, impossible over email and genuinely also a terrible prof who tests you on the most arbitrary minute details she mentions in lecture. The workload was insane with multiple weekly quizzes that all counted towards your grade. Will never take her courses again and recommend the same."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,While her teaching may not be the worst her overall lack of care for students' well-being is incredible. She is rude and condescending in her emails and puts in the absolute minimum effort. Her care for mental health is superficial and she expects you to put her class above all else both classes wise and personal life wise.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Shes super petty and childish over emails and during office hours she gives you this really false reassurance, saying you just need to know the basic patterns of whats taught in lecture, you dont need to know specifics, but then its like the only way to pass her tests is to memorize every word of every slide."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She is rude and cold when you email her. The grading in her class (by TAs or her) is so inconsistent. I got almost perfect one assignment while barely passing another time. This course was challenging and I found it hard to learn the material with her lecture style. Her lectures are short but her assignments and quizzes require more depth.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Extremely disappointing. I was very excited to take biochem but I don't think I'll be taking more BCH courses. Please avoid her classes at all costs. Please. Save yourself.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Assignments made up a large portion of the grade , and were relatively fair but has a lot of reading and research. But the quizzes are a nightmare and you will get highly specific questions that were briefly mentioned or is a little figure on the corner of a slide, so everything is fair game. She can also be pretty rude when you email her so beware"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Her lectures are not helpful and she rushes through them. She talks as if everyone understands every single word she says and has seen the material before. Very hard to follow along in her lectures. Her quizzes are difficult and specific but assignments are fair.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Never seen a more universally disliked prof. Inconsiderate, rude, and quite frankly not at all good at teaching anything. Quizzes etc. really take a toll on your mental health (even if you do well). Unspeakably poor delivery methods, shameless lack of awareness on her part. Horribly pretentious, puts the blame entirely on the students,Just godawful"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"3, 20-minute lectures and 1, 2 hr, slow-paced, ADHD styled tutorial per week. 1. She's clearly reading off a script, making efficient, active-recall type notes impossible. 2. She uses protein-specific examples, expecting us to generalize and apply in assignments. 3. Concepts are brought up as if previous knowledge about it is known by all students"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Genuinely the worst professor I've ever heard. This women is condensing a usual of 4 hours of in person lectures a week to 1 hour of online lectures a week. She teaches the whole course as if it was all highschool review, and is very unaproachable and even condescending when asked questions. Would not reccomend, can't believe I'm paying for this."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Not approachable or helpful. Very passive aggressive in her emails to students. She puts in the bare minimum. I dont know how she won a teaching award.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Quizzes are terrible 15 minute 10 questions, lectures are pretty useless. Assigments garbage as well. Overall terrible prof."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Just generally great prof.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,AVOID HER! She much more horrible than anything else except the COVID19. We only got 1hour lecture per week and was quizzed on everything and everydetail. You never know what will be on the quiz. And the BBQ question are even worse since they are supposed to be what student can do right after the lecture and in fact they are as ridiculus as quizzes
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"There's no way she has a 2.5 because she doesn't even deserve a 1. Whatever small detail she says in the lecture, guarantee you it will be on the quiz. Don't bother asking her anything its a waste of your time cuz she'll go out of her way to comment on every little thing to make you feel like the dumbest person"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Dr. Patterson is quite literally the worst professor I've ever had. Extremely inconsiderate and doesn't care about the success of her students. She refuses to adjust things despite complaints from the entire class and blames lack of studying for not doing well in her class when she doesn't explain concepts properly. AVOID THIS CLASS!
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Worst class so far, terrible teache has no consideration for her students. The textbook is useless, 4 hours lectures per week normally are condensed to 1 hr per week. Sildes are useless and doesn't actually contain the key details. The lectures ae fast paced and it is like she is reading a script. AVOID TAKING BCH210 with this prof."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Worst prof I've had. She has no pedagogy. Her lectures don't match the testing and there's nothing but testing. It's like watching someone drive a car then you're expected to know how to drive on a highway with full traffic right away right away and you're graded for it. There's no opportunity to actually learn anything.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Worst course I've ever taken! She doesn't quiz on what she taught!!!
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Tests were extremely hard and more often than not there would be questions that were never mentioned in the class or even slides. Most random things could pop up on the exam. Do not recommend at all.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,I found Prof. Patterson to be very unapproachable and even rude. And it was difficult to learn from her pre-recorded lectures.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She tests on things that were barely or never discussed in lectures. Be prepared to transcribe everything she says or you will fail.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"It's quite surprising to see how high her rating is. It should be like 0.25. We had 5 assignments throughout the summer semester, and each one takes at least 3 days to complete. Extremely time-consuming and not good for your mental health. Don't ever take biochem with her."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"BCH210 online was a mistake. Lectures were rushed and unenthusiastic, and the quizzes were unfairly hard for the time limit. The assignments were tedious and time-consuming where we were expected to teach ourselves an entirely new concept instead of applying what we have been learning in lectures. It's hard to retain anything from this course."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Never try to take BCH210 in summer. Too tight and disgusting assignments.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Online this summer was the second time I got to take the course with Patterson. During the fall in person, the lectures were actually good and she was considerate out of class. Online, however, she became a different person. She rushed the content (3-6 hours to 100 minutes) and was rude/condescending/unaccommodating with problems/questions."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,The writing assignments were absolutely heavy and unpleasant. The course kills my interest in biochem forever.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"The assignments she gave were awful, extremely time-consuming. Her lectures seem simple but her test questions and assignments are insane. Taking online class with Patterson was the worst idea of my life I'd rather go through orgo 2 again."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"One of the worst professors I've had at UofT. Her explanations outside of lectures are extremely vague, and she responds to questions in a very condescending manner. Her quizzes are difficult, and contain material that was discussed for less than a minute during lectures. The course is very interesting, she's just unnecessarily difficult."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I get that we, as university students, are responsible for learning the materials. But as a professor, you are responsible for HELPING US LEARN, not screwing us over with insanely hard quizzes and assignments. It feels like I learn more from Google than her. AVOID HER IF YOU CAN."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,There is a reason why everyone hates her. The lectures are supposed to be 6 hours a week in the summer and since it's online she just decided to give us a 100-minute lecture a week. That's about 10 hours for the whole summer semester. This is supposed to be an introductory course and it's funny how she assumes us to understand biochem in 10 fkn hrs
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She's just awful. She literally tests you on small details that were mentioned just once in her lectures, so you basically have to write every single word she says. The weekly quiz is a time attack. 10 harsh questions given only 15 minutes. If you politely ask her sth, she just blames on you. Just horrible."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,THE worst. Unapproachable and when students posted questions she would rudely respond or blame it on us. Someone politely posted if she could disclose the class average for her midterm (it was VERY low and hence wasn't said). She responded with a paragraph about how the student should focus on themselves and if they did bad that's their fault
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her online lecture's so fast-paced and mentions the tiniest details in such a short amount of time. I literally have to pause every five seconds and go back to write things she says down. The quizzes are ridiculously hard compared to what is taught to us. When emailed about this, she gave no sh*t and blamed the student for not studying enough."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Lectures are short and not too detailed but the quizzes are soooo detailed. I wish she could explain more and ask questions that she talked about in lectures.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"While Dr. Patterson does do a good job of making her lectures interesting, it is evident that she rushes through her slides. She mentions the most minuscule of details that are very hard to catch, and this is made more frustrating when she decides to ask questions on tests based on these slight details. Overall, I had a terrible experience."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She gets a whole lotta hate for making the tests hard. However, its not impossible to get a A in this class, as she is a decent lecturer and she is always accessible in office hours."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She's honestly a pretty good professor, she's very good at explaining concepts in a way that helps students understand them easily. However, her tests were very hard, she tests on a lot of minor details so just knowing the general concepts of things isn't going to cut it."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"hate the mark breakdown of this course and how quizzes have such a short time limit (10 questions in 10 minutes, without being able to see all of the questions at once). i'm sure students have complained about this in all the past years yet nothing has been done about it, and we keep suffering year after year"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Hardest course I've taken at UofT. She isn't a bad prof but her tests are extremely difficult. She made me hate this course. In fact, many people dropped out :("
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Horrible Prof
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Doesn't explain things well. Very difficult
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Part 3 of this course can be a little bit overwhelming with all the pathways and reactions. But i found that the material itself is actually very interesting! Her lecture slides were organized and she explained the materials very clearly. Overall, a great experience."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Was scared to take a course with her because of the horrible reviews. Her content is hard but if you know the material, her test is easy! Good prof overall, makes you think but doable."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her delivery method is wrong. Get ready for passive lectures. She is a nice a person, but so nice for your GPA."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Professor Patterson understands this is a hard section and tries her best to convey the material. However slides could be a bit more structured with more points rather than pictures or simply talking about it. Would also appreciate a slower delivery of the learning material considering its difficult nature to understand and memorize.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Probably the best professor for this course. Her content is more rigorous and memorization heavy, but her slides and explanations are clear enough to make it easier to understand. She also takes a lot of questions during lecture (through an app). However, the exam tests tiny details and you truly have to memorize everything she teaches."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I found her to be a very good prof, however, she seemed a little bit unapproachable to me. I had questions after every lecture, and it was almost like she was a little bit impatient. Her final exam, like everyone is saying, is tough but fair."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Gives good clear lectures. Her slides are organized and easy to follow. The basics are on the slides and any additional info you need to know will be told during lecture.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I honestly liked all of the profs for this course, but Dr. Patterson was one of my favourites because she delivered content with a lot of enthusiasm, and made it extremely interesting to learn. She was clear, concise and organized, and her test questions were extremely fair. 10/10 would recommend."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her section is the hardest, but most interesting and rewarding section of BCH210. Lots and lots of content for metabolism but it can be done, you just have to study very very hard!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She is nice in class. She is a devil on the exam. Do not skip a word she says or you will die after the exam.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Dr. Patterson is TOUGH, but she genuinely cares about her students succeeding and understanding the material. I found her section to be without a doubt the most challenging during BCH210, but she explains everything incredibly clearly and is so knowledgable about it. Ask her questions! Put in effort and you'll pass with flying colours."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Good lecturer, mean about grades though. She gave us an exit ticket (pop quiz) during a UofT lockdown where some of the students were stuck in the locked down buildings and made no changes to these students' grades. The exam was extremely hard and unfair and her practice questions were not indicative of the level of difficulty of the exam."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Goes through material really fast, doesn't reply to emails. Overall unfair like most life science courses at U of T."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Amazing Prof. I dont know why everyone is saying her final was hard? It was really fair if not easy in my opinion. If you want to do well read, understand and memorize everything just like any other BIO/BCH course. But overall Patterson is Great!"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She writes the kind of final you need two weeks to study for. You know when she says, revise these mechanisms, know those regulatory mechanisms? listeeen k its gud4u"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She was an amazing prof! Test was super fair and she made a lot of material seem like a breeze! 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,Dr. Patterson was really nice! Her exam had some tough questions so make sure you really know your stuff!
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Best professor ever. Her voice is really soothing, and she definitely knows what she's talking about. Her slides and the way she teaches is extremely clear. At the end of the day, she makes sure you understand everything. Her evaluations are also extremely fair. She is the definition of the perfect professor"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She is a good lady. She explains concepts very clearly.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,She has a good personality. Sh explains concepts very clearly.
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Very helpful, patient, and explains concepts clearly."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210BCH311,Just horrible. 
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH210BCH311,"Pretty vague explanations in lecture but a very knowledgeable lecturer. Recordings don't do much justice on her tests like other BCH profs since she adds most the points on to the lecture slides. That said, shes challenging in the sense that she speaks expecting her audience to know the stuff and the fact that she teaches the harder sections"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH311,"I asked her what pages to read for so and so lectures. she said read what is taught in the lectures. i like to pre-read lectures so i know what to expect. she talks fast, doesnt repeat anything. shes out of her enthusiasm juice. shes better than ProfAndreopoulos though i'll giver her that. Record all BCH311 lectures. very important."
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH311,"Let me just put it this way: she said we didn't need to know any of the material on one of the slides, it was just for our interest. Then in a term test out of only 35, 5 marks were dedicated to a short answer question based on the content on that slide. Rushes lectures, doesn't explain things well, and the test was just unfair"
University Of Toronto,Sian Patterson,BCH311,"Irresponsible, doesn't clear up what to read from 180 pages of Textbook, assigns an article that is way too technical for a general BCH with 3 lectures on all nucleotides overall course and pulls a question out of it anyway. Her quizzes just wanna trick you into choosing the wrong option especially when you know your stuff too well. NOPE."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT100,"Michael Khan as a person just seems like a regular nice prof. I do dislike how you have to purchase the textbook to access the quizzes. The more you attend and pay attention to lecture, the better you will do, guessed MC textbook questions in final and did well in the written portions to succeed. Be involved, and you'll do just fine in the course."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT100,"He forces you to buy his textbook to take tests. He talks about himself too much. He wants to be different from other profs, saying ""everything including student answers are testable""."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT100,This man makes 400k a year and doesn't deserve a penny. His huge ego makes him a condescending prof and it gets in the way of his teaching. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT100,"MGT100 was a great course, though was based heavily on memorization rather than understanding of concepts. The lectures were fantastic, and had guest speakers and people from industry coming in to talk about their work. Prof. Khan is a good lecturer and encourages participation, but there are only three assessments, making it difficult to keep up."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT100,"Amazing professor! I have to admit my grade was not as high as I had anticipated for it to be. However I do not regret taking the course at all. Had early 9am lectures, and he was very very engaging during his lectures. Having a class with him gives you an opportunity to get your name out and build connections. Great prof cant say it enough."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT100,"Arrogant, requires you to buy his personal tb and extra stuff like pointless tophat. Takes attendance before class starts, goes on about how you need to get to know him and not to ask him for recommendations if he doesn't know you. Guest lecturers are cool to have but boring. Lecture heavy AND tests on A LOT of tb based material. Exams are hard."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT422,He is honestly a very nice and funny guy. Visit office hours and participate regularly and he will get to know you quickly. He provides allot of feedback if you ask and will redirect you to very smart T.A's.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,MGT422,"Talks about he has all the designations (CPA, CISA, CGEIT), talks about he's the only person that can teach MGT422 / RSM427 because he is the only one with those designations. Pointless slides, every slide has the word ""inefficiency"" in it. Lectures are not related to any case or MCQ. MCQs are messed up. Cases are long and boring. Worst course ever"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Course is doable (and aceable) if you attend lectures and write down all key case studies. Make sure to read textbook as multiple choice is heavily tested on the textbook. Do the wiley plus questions as well -- those are great practice. You got this! Fighting! 
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan is a solidly good professor. He teaches well, and it is very lecture heavy. As for the exams, there are not any surprises in regards to the content, but it was suspected that he down curved the final. Overall, not a bad course, but he did overcomplicate a very simple & vague class, that really does not require much critical thinking. "
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan was a great professor! Do not believe the other reviews, I let them scare me going into first year. If you speak to Michael directly, you get to know him and find out he cares about his students. Participating in class does carry weight (the syllabus won't say this). Midterm is curved heavily. Final is NOT curved down, just not curved."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan gave solid introduction to Management and to Rotman Commerce. Lectures were based of the underlying content in the textbook readings, with several different real-world cases, which will all be tested. This does mean that attendance is absolutely mandatory as tests are weighted more on class content. Overall, great engaging professor!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Personally I found this class to be easy as long as you went to lectures and read the textbook. Not too bad. The lectures are engaging and the prof is nice. 
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"""Everything is testable!"" I hate that!!!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Liked Khan a lot, it just felt like he lied to us about not curving down. Everyone I know had their mark drop at least 10% after the final, so make sure you have a really good grade going into the final and be prepared to have it drop even if the final feels easy. "
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"All the people giving low reviews are simply those who didn't attend lectures and didn't put in enough work. Sit at the front, study well, and you will do great. Exams are literally a piece of cake if you study enough. Thank you, Prof. Khan, aka Top G, you will be missed! "
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Prof. Khan is Top G at Rotman, his lectures are entertaining, and he tries to keep students actively engaged. However the course is quite difficult. The midterm and final exam make up over 60% of your mark at every single word, slideshow, and tiny detail he says in a lecture including guest speaker notes are testable. "
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Turned an easy, informing course into an unnecessary struggle simply to weed out students in year 1. Prof Mike does not do much himself except lecture. Not accessible and simply useless."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Mr. Khan is the G.O.A.T! Khan is a chill guy and he wants you to succeed in the course, while everything is testable and can sometimes be boring he does his best to keep you engaged. 

I went to office hours and he was clear and concise when it came to answering my questions. 

PS Find a good group for the Group Assignment and participation matters"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is pretty funny but tries to make the course unnecessarily hard. Even if you memorize everything from lecture and textbook, he finds ways to deduct marks on tests. Final was worth 40% and they curved down a lot. Group project was worth 25%, so you need to find a good group! You don't learn a lot when you are forced to memorize 20pgs a week..."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Go to class and takes notes word for word and memorize them the night before the exam like your life depends on it. Aside from that you dont have to do any work throughout the semester
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"I took the course in Fall 2019. Michael Khan was an ok prof, he made lectures engaging, but I wouldn't say he was the nicest or most approachable. He made the course challenging when it really shouldn't have been. Questions on tests were also not representative of what we spent most time learning."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Imagine being a 4.0 student all year until the final exam pulls you down 15 points for no rhyme or reason. The entire class was curved down heavily and I pity those who have to go through Khan's ego infested course again. He sells you his own textbook and teaches only from his life. Most of the class is easy, but be ready to worship his every word."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Hes a fraud who sells his own textbook to students. Be prepared for easy marks at the beginning of the year, and then have the final drop your score 10-20% for no reason. Memorize every word that comes from his mouth, it will be on the tests."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Didn't learn a single applicable concept, but I can tell you why Michael Khan loves Disney's corporate culture."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Tests on his personal life stories rather than concepts within the textbook.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"This is a required course for Y1st Rotman Commerce students. The Lecture contents are enjoyable and professor Khan is an excellent prof and educator. However, the course tasks allocation and grading system are a little challenging. To make sure you pass the course successfully, fully engaged with in-class recordings, slides, course material."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"The professor is fine and the class is engaging. However, it's certainly important to listen to every word he said during the class, especially the guest lecture. Pay attention to the picture in the power point. The guest and professor would drop hint on the test question so LISTEN CAREFULLY. Overall, it's not a hard course but required much effort"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,The GOAT. Prof Khan is one of the best profs you will have in Rotman first year. Midterms and finals are easy and short if you study correctly. Everything in lectures are testable which makes it easy to study. (he drops hints on important questions). My friend and I predicted every question that was on our final. Pick a good group for business plan
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Prof Khan is a great person, his lectures are engaging and interesting. Guest lectures are very interesting and you will learn a good bit about how business works. However, tests are hard as everything is testable and youre forced to remember the littlest of details, which is counterproductive"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Overall, case studies done in class are interesting and engaging. However, everything is testable. Make sure you take good notes in class about everything he says and questions that are being asked!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Michael khan. SUCKS. GOOD LUCK LOL IM GLAD THIS CLASS WAS OVER IM NEVER TAKING HIM AGAIN IF I CAN HELP IT.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"His lectures actually are fine. But the final is too tough, everything is testable."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Khan's lectures were interactive, fun and very interesting (especially because of the guest lecturers). He gives students a chance to speak. But his tests are very heavily based on memorization and not having knowledge on the course. One question asked the guest lecturer's companies name which seemed pointless. Grades depend on the lectures!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Amazing professor. He is kind and it is your first opportunity in Rotman Commerce to network with a valuable person. He provides great insights. His course is tough but definitely one of my favourite courses in the semester.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,lowest marks i've ever gotten in my life in this class.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Very caring. He's the only one who took 30 minutes out of his lecture time to do a mental Health Check and make sure that students knew about the support they have on campus. Be prepared to memorize a lot in RSM100! But, his lectures are very interactive and he always gives students a chance to talk so it's easy to rmmbr course concepts."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,He uses proctoru which is an invasion of a personal privacy of our living space for exams and should never do... He also speaks very fast in lectures. No one can understand what he says He gives a very difficult midterm and final with (30-50%) avg range with no bell curve at all in order to lower the averages... Do not take the course with him
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Curved down on the final; mainly tested students on how much they cared for his class and whether one could demonstrate ones ability to memorize frivolous details of his lectures. The exam prep process was a waste of time
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Quite hard to get a good grade. Dont expect rsm100 to boost your GPA. Lectures were interesting, I like how he teaches with cases."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"So many Khan horror stories, but he's actually pretty solid. Study for the tests and try to get a good mark on the group project. Final drags everyone down."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Lectures are engaging. Textbook heavy, remember the vocab and italic ones. The exam tested mostly on lecture content, rewatch the recordings, draw a mind map and write out possible quest if have time. Very knowledgeable and fast pace. U can learn a lot about the contemporary bus in his course"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"overall great prof, REALLY wish I got to attend his in-person lectures and chat with him outside of class - seems like a cool guy. obviously there's online office hours, but it's just not the same. (btw hi prof khan, you said you read these so..)"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Definitely not my favourite prof but I surely learned a lot from him. He made a really good effort to adjust to online learning. And he made lectures more interesting with his case studies. However, his course shouldnt be taken for granted. Its pretty tough so make sure you spend time studying for it."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan provided with engaging lectures and lots of case studies but his whole ""everything is testable"" and giving vague instructions was not it. I think he was a lot more chill this year due to it being online and he actually tested on important topics on the final and not some random slide in the 10 different slide decks."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"uses really bad TA, give super low scores for case competitions, doesn't respect student, when requesting for regrade, doesn't take it seriously"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"I got a 64% the first time and had to redo the course. Got a 90% second time around and enjoyed it more due to the smaller class size and better conversations. Take word for word notes during class, if you write your own opinion than you might get 0/5 on the question (even if it's a good opinion)"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"LISTEN IN CLASS. everything said in class will have a chance to show up on the exam. one of our midterm question was ""on X day in class we talked about X news item, please explain what was discussed in class."" You need to write the key words down, word for word, or else it's wrong. The group project was a hit or miss. Depends on your group mates."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Overloaded class. Class is either meant to be yearlong or have lesser work. Don't learn a lot. He sells his textbook to make extra money on the side . The final contains questions not covered in class.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan is the stereotypical business person. Has proper manners and seems like a fair negotiable person but will then stab you in the back with a ridiculously hard final which is difficult for no reason. Attend lectures, take notes ""everything is testable"". idk what Rotman did to this guy but whatever it is he's def taking it on the class GL"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"I personally like Professor Khans way of teaching. All lectures, discussions and textbook readings are testable so you have to equally divide your focus on these. If really work hard in this class, youll easily get an A. Its bird course if you are the type of student who studies 360 degrees and a hard course if you only study half of everything."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"You could grind on your assignment, but someone who put no work into their assignment could get a higher mark than you. The grading was so random. For the final exam, I studied tons and knew every question. I left the final with my mark 7% lower. It feels like they mark unfairly to keep the class average low. Worst RSM course. Not hard - unfair"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He tries to act sympathetic with the students only to stab us in the back on the final exam. His written response section is designed to drag the class average down and he won't give it back so you can't get it remarked. The marking scheme for written response is ridiculous - if you don't have the exact wording, you'll get it wrong."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He wants the exact specifics and wording covered in class and will test material that you would overlook just to catch you off-guard. Overall, a really nice and funny guy... likes talking about himself but he keeps lectures fun and engaging. I loved going to class."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Actually if you go to his lectures and take good notes, you should be fine. I did spend lots of time on this course but don't feel I have learned anything though."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,DANONE USES A MULTIDOMESTIC STRATEGY. Enough said.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Gives you a good overview of business also catches you up on current events. Group project is a hit or miss. Got a 99% on it while others got low 70s. ASK FOR UPPER YEARS PROJECTS and DO ALL ORION QUESTIONS for multiple choice on exam. Write down everything he says in class and even classmates answers. EVERYTHING SAID IN CLASS IS TESTABLE. DONT ZZZ
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"People either love him or hate him. Lectures are interesting. Readings should be done before class since his lectures will barely touch the content, but are related. Midterms/exams are based on orion/wiley multiple choice (DO ALL). Other half of the exam is specific info from lectures (cases) or required readings posted on Querques. Goodluck!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,guy basically bell curved the entire class down by 10% by putting degenerate questions on the exam. So boss
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"I'm at a 96 in the course and am still saying he's a terrible terrible TERRIBLE prof. The readings are so time consuming and useless, and the lectures are so boring but you MUST TAKE GOOD NOTES!! Do the readings, practice quizzes, and don't miss lectures and it's easy to get a good mark, it's just a lotta work. Slack  bad mark."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Tough grader!!!!!!!!!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Terrible prof, rsm100 is pretty much a joke of a course. He marks his short answer very specifically so make sure you write word for word what he says in lectures. Pretty pretentious and cocky guy as well, lectures are just him going over cases and talking about how successful he is."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,You will die with his short answer marking. No joke.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Personally not a fan of his teaching style and courses the way it is designed and the ""everything is testable"" idea simply creates extra stress"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"""U of T, specifically Rotman, doesn't curve down"" - The man whose entire class received a grade between 68 and 78 despite mid 80s pre-test averages"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,I went into the exam with a 4.0 and came out with a 3.0 which was insane considering the content isn't difficult. He's a pretty inconsiderate guy and will tell you to retake the course if you don't like your grade. On average everyone's grade falls by 10% after the exam because of the marking on the short problems. He talked about himself a lot too
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Annoying and full of himself. Spends class time talking about himself/his own accomplishments. Never touches on textbook content in lectures, tests you on textbook content and specific lecture content. Introduction to Management class but i didnt learn a single thing about management in his class. Avoid if possible."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Must attend lectures or you won't pass. Test was hard but exam was really easy.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,the most stupid prof ever
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Was alright until the final, which heavily curved the class down, despite it being a relatively easy exam (expect a 3-10% drop in your mark). Otherwise, very lecture heavy and tests mostly in class discussion. Says that he tests what he says in class but even if you regurgitate his exact words onto the test he'll still find a way to dock your mark."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Khan is an enthusiastic professors and lectures are engaging. However, in order to do well you MUST attend class (midterm and final questions are based on in-class discussions, case studies, textbook content, guest speakers) and read/make notes on the textbook. Downside, the grading by the TAs on long answer questions is NOT reasonable"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Very funny prof, id say he's the most humorous prof at UofT. BUT, rsm100 is no jokes. Nvr talks about content inside the textbook, gets tested on things discussed in class. Be ready to read, memorize and also voice record his lectures! I did rlly bad on midterm cuz note taking things that he wasnt gonna post later was hard. (grade is b4 final)"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"The worst professor ever. He forced us to buy new textbook when I already got a used one. His marking is unreasonable. I only got half of the marks in the short answers section while I wrote down almost everything he said. During the last lecture, he even stated that getting a 4.0 is close to impossible, and he seemed to be proud of this."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Khan is a solid lecturer. He's funny and tries to make lectures interesting. MAKE SURE you go to class and take notes when he is doing class participation or TopHat polls because those questions will end up on the midterm and the final.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is engaging as a professor, but he's kind of full of himself. His scale for measuring participation was a joke, and the final was fair but graded way too aggressively. The wiley quiz answers are on quizlet, but for the midterm and final you need to memorize and be able to explain concepts. Didn't really enjoy his classes."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He gave us a ""seem-to-be"" easy final but the marking criteria was unreasonably tough. Why don't just give us a difficult one and mark it fairly ?"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan is a good lecturer. As a professor, he can seem a little arrogant and annoying. He tends to talk about his summer abroad program non-stop - probably in an attempt to recruit students for future summers. This course is marked relatively tough (C+ or B- average) since it is a Rotman first year course that determines your admission."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Really good prof but really tough. He wrote the textbook so be sure to read like a lot. Must go to the lectures and pay attention to his examples and what he says- it will show up again. Despite such a boring course his lectures were really interesting. Only reason I didnt enjoy him as much is cuz he came halfway through the semester
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"LOVE HIM. SO funny and a great lecturer. So passionate and makes this course so much FUN! He's a great prof. Just study the textbook and do the ORIEN quizzes on wileyplus because those are where the exam questions come from. ALSO, GO TO CLASS. All the examples from in class are on the exam and he does not upload the examples on portal."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,played us too hard with the finals. why make the finals easy if youre gonna get it marked/curved like hell.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,played us too hard with the finals. why make the finals easy if youre gonna get it marked/curved like hell
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan was much better than Oesch. He was engaging, provided valuable examples, and made it clear as to what was being tested. His lectures are worth attending; around 40% of the final is based on in-class discussions. Other than that, the course is textbook-heavy."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Khan will be the nicest prof you are ever gonna get in UofT. Remember to go to his lectures. They are fun and will be extremely helpful for the final exam.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Such a great prof. Very interesting lectures and is hard to fall asleep. Don't know about his accounting lectures but I enjoyed him 10X more than John.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Professor Khan is a great lecturer and encourages class discussion. He is very kind to students especially if you go to his classes so he knows ur face. Ive learned a lot from the two first-year courses he teaches.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"I just toke RSM100 and Khan is a great professor!! He is caring, friendly and professional. Students feel involved in his lectures. The concept is easy to understand and it is really a interesting course :) Such an Unforgettable memories!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Micheal Khan is so nice!!! We love this professor!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,So Sweet Really grate professor Please come to his lecture every time
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Best professor
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Professor Khan is the best!!!!!!!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Great professor, don't understand how anyone could not like him. His lectures are so fun and engaging, unlike John who put everyone to sleep. So fun. Textbook use is mandatory and attend lectures because final exam questions are purely based on class discussions. Overall great prof!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"This Professor does not positively add to the course. His lectures are boring, he is full of himself and  he does not really teach anything of substance. He puts overly specific questions on the exam just to get people to attend lectures and never stops talking about his summer abroad program. Overall, he is not a ""level 5 leader""."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Great lectures, awesome prof. He engages students throughout the lectures; however, you need to attend lectures in order to do well in the course. Also, there is A LOT of textbook reading. If you put in the work, you can do well."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan's lectures are pretty interesting and do contain material that you will be tested on, so go! He is pretty arrogant and loves to talk about himself, though. It can get annoying but at least he isn't boring or anything. Seems like a decent guy overall and does make the material seem pretty interesting."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,amazing prof
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"If you can get a perfect on the final exam, you deserve a cookie. Expect pointless memorization. Most useless class as the concepts are repeated in upper RSM courses."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan made RSM100 as interesting as it possibly could. His teaching style is class discussion based and you have to listen keenly as whatever is discussed is testable (literally, he says it himself).  This class is based on memorization of the text, class discussion and required readings."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"How Khan is rated below at the very least a 4 is beyond me. Amazing engaging prof, super enthusiastic about everything, and taught in a very relevant manner. Difficulty is nowhere near as bad as people say, if you're decent at retaining info you'll get an 80. Sure you have to come to class, but you should be doing that anyway at UofT.."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Good professor. He likes to engage with students and encourages participation. I do not like how he would sometimes pick on students and advertised his summer abroad program too much. He did have interesting lectures, though, as he talked a lot about current events."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"he was clear, had light humour, and humble. Definitely humble. I never participated or went to office hours so this perception of him is strictly from lectures. If you're taking his class you have to read your textbook and do not skip class. But aside from that (which is really the bare minimum) there is not much extra work. Not very challenging."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Final exam focuses on accounting a lot. GO TO ECOMAN FOR THE FINAL FOR RSM WITH MICHAEL KHAN IT WILL HELP ALOT!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Easily my least favourite professor in first year. Thinks too highly of himself that you feel some sort of barrier between yourself as a student and him. If this course was not a requirement I would have dropped it ONLY because I never feel comfortable at his lectures. He shushes students even if only two people are talking. He seems sharp though
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan spends a lot of time talking about himself and he spends a lot of time discussing what people review him about. He then talks about how he took his kids to a farm for their birthday. He'll tell you about his summer abroad program.  He is not a  ""level 5 leader"", as he does not seem to take review criticism very well.  Not a real prof."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is annoying as hell. He enjoys himself more than 90% of his students. He talks really fast. His lectures are mostly pointless (but he puts 50% of lecture stuffs on the final exam..) So basically, he forces his students to attend his boring lectures. The WORSE thing is, he is very ""proud' of himself. "
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is a good lecturer, I found his lectures to be interesting. Watch out for the exam because he tests on lecture material and in class discussions. Overall, I loved this class and found him to be a great professor. If you read the textbook and attend class, you will have no problem getting a good grade in this class."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan was an OK teacher- not the best, nor the worst. He just seems full of himself, and spends way too much time promoting his Summer Abroad Program. A bit tricky when it comes to his exam- you have to know all material (whether it be from the textbook or lecture slides) in and out. Also, attend class when there are guest lecturers!"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,"Lectures are useless from a material standpoint, he needs to add irrelevant test questions based on the overly specific lecture material just to get people to attend. Way, way too into himself. Jst likes to hear himself talk, especially if it's picking apart a student's earnest question. Didn't attend any lectures second semester and still got an A"
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,He talks really fast and tests us more of his lecture than the textbook. Gosh...who will pay attention for almost full year course and remember everything from his talking? The materials for final were so much including the freaking chapters and his lectures and so on. Dislike.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Some snake tings in hurr. Tests be super hard and manz be failing in hurr. Serious snake movements in class #DustySweaterVest
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,Prof is very very boring and is pretty useless. Test is super hard. test is 50% textbook and 50% from lecture. You really need to think in the exam and recall what is taught in class and think outside the box. I think the course average is around 50% but oh well. rotman need to kick people out anyways
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,He is pretty good but moves through subject matter very fast.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100,He is an amiable man who enjoys his own classes ore than the students do. His efforts to make the class lively and entertaining often end in making the classes useless to the students as the material taught is negligible. His tests often consist more of what is in the textbook than what is taught in class.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM100RS,So warm
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM1222,"(1)Out of 20 professors, he was the WORST.(2)Had a 20% participation grade but taught very poorly and elicited little interest from us.(3)He screwed us over in the final exams. Gave us a 3hr long paper for 2hrs. The first 50% were extremely easy questions, and the last 2 were cases - one was actually 3 pages of reading. No1 finished all questions."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM219,The professor is so kind!!!!!!!Not a tough grader.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,I don't understand what's the point of mandatory participation which takes 20% of the entire course. He asks for students' feedback but don't worry cuz he won't change anything about his teaching style.
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,"Khan was not a good prof for RSM100. I got him for RSM426, and MY GOODNESS! He is so much better in 4th year. His style of teaching and his extensive and interactive lectures helped us learn more from his one course than anything else I have done in my fourth year. The multiple-choice on his tests is out of nowhere but other than that, very fair."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,i hate him. you HAVE to participate because its worth 20% out of the entire grade. does not give any leniency on participation marks at ALL even though we are all in a pandemic and given the technical difficulties and time zone issues students faced smh
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,Make sure you attend all class and ACTIVELY RAISE AND ANSWER QUESTION IN CLASS!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,"Surprisingly, Michael Khan in 427 is different than Michael Khan in RSM100. He's alot more chill and the course isn't designed to fail you. If you put in a solid effort, you'll do well. Alot of group assignments and class participation. Tests aren't based on the technical topics but rather what was discussed in class."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,Took him last year. Terrible prof. One of the descriptions I gave him was 'hilarious' as in hilariously bad. 15% of course mark is on participation with an unrealistic rubric so he will screw you over if you get on his bad side. Talks a lot about himself which no one really cares about. Very unfortunate that he's the only one teaching this course!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,Prof that ruin my life!
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,Not Good
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSM427,"This prof is one of those people you have to get to know. He is a very genuine, honest, and friendly guy who likes to be friendly with his students. Very out-of-the-box most of the times, although lectures can be monotonous sometimes due to the dry course subject matter. All in all, great prof. We're very lucky to have him in Rotman."
University Of Toronto,Michael Khan,RSML020,"For the most part, I enjoyed this class even though I had taken this already at CAPE. He is an approachable prof. However, I found that he wasn't very fair when it came to marking participation. Some people who made a moderate attempt in participation got 7/10 whereas others who participated more didn't even pass/barely passed."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,1300,Good prof. Hard tests though.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,1300,"Would not recommend !! There are 3 tests overall, two midterms each worth 30% and one final worth 40%. There are 60 questions and 65 minutes for the test, it is all multiple choice and half of those questions are on the readings. He does not post the lecture material online so be prepared to type fast, class average on tests is around 69.7%. "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,1300,I swear he must be writing the good reviews on here lol! He is an awful prof! I would not recommend him to anyone! He is condescending! He also test on minute details from the textbook! Avoid !!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,1300,Easy class funny prof
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,2106,Great Prof gets the class involved and doesn't read from his notes like most profs I know
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,2106,He is the funnist prof - awesome class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,2109,"not extremely helpful when asking questions,"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,ANT2103,His exams really rely on the textbook/reading materials so make sure you really take notes. It won't be hard to get a good grade if you really pay attention. His live lectures aren't really related to the course material unless it's a powerpoint. He's a funny guy tho.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,Very good prof and loves what he does which is criminology
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,Prof Alvaro makes the best use of technology and sparks great conversation. Going to class is optional but shouldn't be missed because discussion-based learning means a lot of material is covered through real-world examples. There is so much reading though and you will be tested on it. Don't take this class if you prefer lecture-based courses. 
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"His video lessons are very visual, which was super nice, but the lectures are a total waste of time !! I wish we went over the material during them ... instead, he does kahoots and talks to the class."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,The exams he makes are ridiculous and he does not go over anything in his lectures.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,The classes are 3 hour long but not much is done in those hours and it is not useful for exams.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"do ! not ! take ! his ! class !! worst prof ever and doesnt even teach! lectures are just games which is annoying bc the tests are hard and based on the material he doesnt actually go thru. it takes all my will to get thru his ""lectures"" bc of his unfunny jokes. too many assignments and too arrogant for someone who does not do much"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"Stop whatever you're doing, and TAKE HIS CLASS I would do it all over again!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"Out of my 10 first year profs ... he is by far the worst! He is funny and his lectures are interesting, but you are not graded on the lectures at all!!! Good luck remembering the smallest of details from the textbook !! You can write the exam from home, and even with friends from the class? No regulations ... u can use google when writing the exam"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,There was a lot of homework in the class and he is a very tough grader.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"Started my first class ever with a large group snapchat. Genuinely seems interested in his students and takes care of sensitive subjects. One of those ""cool"" teachers."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"made the class funny and interesting, he likes to interact with the students and tries to learn everyones name. Do not be shy with him he likes when people give comments and discussion. Make sure to do the reading most of the readings are on the midterms/final. overall great class, I learned a lot"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CMN3117,"awesome guy! funny, interesting, and up to date! i love the fact that he saves the rest of the class from the unnecessary rambelings of some. very well informed in his area of knowledge... i mean you actually go in there and you learn...  great guy!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM,I found him to be good at maintaining our interest in the material but WHAT A COMPLETE JERK!! He was so rude every time I tried to approach him with a question.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM,"He is extremely conceited and self-absorbed and he thinks he is much more intellgent than he is.  If you are a female, prepared to suck up, then you may do well in one of his courses.  If not, then I suggest you choose a different professor."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Very funny and entertaining professor. Lectures were decently enjoyable. Only complaint is that some questions on exams are based on small, easy-to-miss details in the textbook."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Okay, so I took it as a summer course from 7-10 pm. And honestly I Never attend my classes but I literally never skip this one. He is interesting and makes the topic relatable to daily life. He engages with students and is clear on instructions and marks fairly."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Horrible teacher, horrible grading system, gets his TAs to do everything for him. also rude lol. i wouldnt take his classes if ur not willing to dedicate 100% of ur time to it"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"He was super funny and interesting, and the lectures were fun at times. This is a class where you have to go 100% of the time and read ALL of the texts (in detail). The exams are online but they include even the most minor details from the textbook or lectures. If you want an A, you need to work HARD."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Classes always end short except the last class before the exam where he crams things in.most of what he says during class is just extra fun stuff or just copied directly from the textbook. Read the textbook you will get most answers, doesnt post slides though, so you have to be  in class to get the canadian stats since textbook is american."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"He was a good, funny teacher but he was an extremely hard marker.  No one I've talked to passed the essay and I'm pretty sure the only reason I got a C was because of bellcurving.  Good guy though."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM,"I loved this prof. Doesn't spoon-feed his student. Loves when people speak up in class, and will challenge you to make you deepen your thinking. I definitely recommend him."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1100,"Seems to be an easy class, but it really is not. Very tough grader and we were tested on material not covered in any of the lectures or the text book. He's hilarious, but he can be very moody. Beware."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1100,"didn''t do anything, relied on TAs"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1101,"Trys to act ""connected"" & teaches class like Pacino would as M.Corleone. Mocks/insults students when they contribute diff. views. Midterm was FILLED with errors. ex. same Q repeated, poor grammer in multi-Ch Q. so they did not make sence.  REFUSED to ANS Q. about the midterm while I was writing!!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1101,"This guy is really fun to listen to in lectures. He makes funny jokes and swears on occasion. His tests arent easy, but you like to be entertained and you're willing to study- Sam Alvaro is a good choice."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Exams are hard (30/30/40 split, 1min per MC) and all online with no lockdown software. The textbook is very expensive and required, along with very dense. Stick to reading chapter summaries and you'll be fine. His exams are taken word for word from Quizlets. Alvaro can be condescending and rude when you ask a question, and lectures are very fast."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Alvaro is obsessed with being perceived as cool and with the times. He makes unfunny jokes about TikTok, furries and the Kardashians. He is very condescending when students share their opinion in class. READ THE TEXTBOOK he copy pastes passages on exams verbatim. All his exams and midterms are online which is nice. Notes are not posted anywhere."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Great professor, get ready to be quizzed on the most detailed bits of information from the textbook. The midterms were difficult (1 question per minute online), however, he does offer a 2% bonus to your final mark if you complete an assignment. His slides were huge chunks of information that he couldn't be bothered to turn into bullet points. "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He's OK, its a lot of reading over 300+ pages just to be questioned about the smallest details ever to be found in  the textbook, no matter how much you go over the notes+textbook, you can never really get higher than a 60-70 in my experience. He doesn't post notes he goes really fast while presenting the notes and barely goes back to the previous."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof Alvaro is 1 of the best profs I've had. He connects with students (bring up the Kardashians and TikTok ALL the time). He is really funny and keeps the classes engaging. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he doesn't post lectures or PP, and the reading is mandatory for the exams (which are pretty easy). If you can, take a class with Prof Alvaro! "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Such a useless prof. Gets paid 100k to post prerecorded lectures that were completely edited by his TA's. Taught myself the entire course through the textbook. Actually showing up to class is a waste of time, all we did was kahoots and he made cringy jokes. Midterms and exam completey based on random tidbits of info in the textbook, so goodluck."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"I had this prof once a week for about 2.5 hours, and that's probably the only negative aspect of the class. Prof. Alvaro himself is really engaging; he likes interacting with students and tries to get to know everyone. Plus, he's really knowledgeable about the subject and prefers to teach Crim through group discussions."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Tests/exams are super hard. Super reading-based, make sure you take DETAILED notes. Class is a waste of time but hours of lecture content is posted online instead"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"lectures were a huge waste of time. our three hour lectures, that would consist of stupid kid games and random conversations would always be cut about an hour short because there ""wasn't enough content to fill three hours"" but he would post hours worth of information for us to teach ourselves throughout the week. avoid at all costs!! smh"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Speaking from taking the course online. Cool guy, terrible prof. He expects way too much from his students. Like are we really going to remember a small insignificant statement from the first week of class? His lectures are not interesting enough to ask such specific questions on a final. If youre looking for an fun, easy elective this aint it."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"This teacher gave me depression, I am going through mental trauma after these exams they questions have no connection with the course material. highly disturbing do not recommend one bit."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Classes were interesting. Tests were hard. He was a very lazy prof, and had a temper. He let his TA do all the work and didn't do any one-on-one interaction with students at all. Exams were based solely on the readings, making class attendance useless. I am glad that I only had one class with him."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He's an excellent and interesting lecturer, extremely good at explaining criminological concepts which was very fresh and engaging to listen to. Test content is a nightmare though, you will spend a LOT of time with your textbook. Open book exams, but all multiple choice with odd diction. Id rec him IF you have lots of free time to read. Decent!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,His lectures are engaging however as mentioned before he IS a very lazy prof. All midterms online so you can work with friends etc (recommended) but they have nothing to do with what he teaches in class? Scared to put my hand up bc he often mocks students in front of the class. Interesting content so a shame he lacks effort/passion as an educator.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Lectures are note heavy, he doesn't upload ANYTHING online. Lectures barely used in tests, which are usually focused on the texts and textbook, on the smallest details. Would NOT recommend, worst prof I had in first year."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He is the worst professor I have had at U of O. He doesnt not care for his students, as his tests do not reflect what he teaches. The questions on the test are about random facts from the textbook, which shows that he is a lazy professor, as he does not make the questions himself. He does not care for his students, and I would AVOID at all costs!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof Alvaros lectures are interesting, but that is the only positive thing I can say about his classes. The tests are all online and do not match what he teaches in class. Many of the questions are small facts that are buried in the textbook. He does not put the time in to help students, which shows that he is a selfish and careless professor."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Just wrote his crm1300 final... the exam DID NOT reflect what we talked about in class! Everything is small details from the textbook, and not fundamental aspects of criminology.. absolutely terrible prof and teaching style!! Everything is online so you can google or work with friends , but that is not impartial and fair to ur actual knowledge!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"I enjoy his classes, they are very fun! After that, it all goes down hill. His tests are not on what he talks about in class!! Very frustrating! His questions are based around minute details in the textbook... its a 500 page textbook. His grades discussions are marked on how to cite properly ... even though we have never talked about it in class??"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He seems to be a nice guy, but he is not passionate about teaching. He gives you an entire textbook and then tests you on it. Do NOT be fooled, it is hard. His lectures are engaging, but you are not really tested on his lectures, and are tested on the textbook. His tests use odd diction, so it is easy to get questions wrong for no reason... AVOID"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"His lectures are very interesting, for he discusses pop culture very often. Although, on saying this, his class is very tough. His exams are multiple choice with only a minute per question. You must read the textbook because that is where all of his difficult questions come from. For a first year intro class he is very hard, but he is a fun prof."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Very good prof, his lectures are engaging and interesting. Although you do learn a lot in his class, his exams are very very tough. Be prepared to study very hard for his exams."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof is hilarious, makes references to pop culture to make the content relatable and relevant. Participation is encouraged and he will call on people randomly. midterm and final are online and theres a paper. slides are NOT posted online and no laptops so you gotta go to class and write them in a notebook. overall decent though"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He is very funny and entertaining. He knows how to keep the course interesting. Make sure to do your readings which is what most of the tested content is on, otherwise you will not do very well. One online midterm, one paper and one online final."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,better bring that nameplate to class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Such an awesome prof! He likes class discussions which is really great and help you understand the content. The midterms were very easy and the final was a take home which helped lessen the stress of finals. No lectures are posted online so pay attention in class. He awards extra credit for attendance and certain questions regarding the readings.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Great Prof. He makes his lectures very interesting and engaging, although pay attention because he does not post slides to Blackboard. There are two online midterms (60 MC each) and a final take home exam. Do the readings because they will help on the exams, and he will award extra credit for questions that are answered from the text in class."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof Alvaro is the best. Tries to learn everyones names. Only 2 online midterms and a take home final. Super interesting and really into what he teaches, finds it important to have actual discussions about random news. Loved this class thanks to him"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Truly cares about every student. One day he asked us ""where's everyone's name plates? You aren't a number... you're a person"". Very interesting lectures. Genuinely sad that I might not have him as a prof for the rest of my crim years. "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Professor Alvaro is a wonderful example of what all other professors should want to be. He loves to engage in conversation and discussion with the students during the course of his lectures. He is great!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Absolutely hilarious, very clear about what he expects, overall an awesome prof. No notes online, but his lectures are so fun and engaging you want to go to them. Marks very fairly, and if you study, you will definitely pass. If you can, take this course. "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Hilarious and awesome dude, except for the fact that he only prefers his answers for questions asked in class. Don't fact-check what he says, because a lot of the time his points are wrong. Midterm questions are oddly specific, maybe based on one sentence out of the text. Overall interesting course, except thoroughly biased by Alvaro."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,He's a hilarious prof and made lectures go by quickly! His midterms are easy if you attend all the classes (since notes aren't posted online) and read the textbook. He tends to end class early and is very interactive with the students. He always greets us and asks how are we doing. Strongly recommend him :) 
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Two MC midterms based solely off the readings so going to class was pointless in that perspective but the professor himself was what made the classes worth going too. Overall nice guy, does like to call you out (in what he thinks is a good-natured way, and is unless you dislike being called out). Would 100% recommend this professor if possible!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"This course was 2 midterm exams and 1 Paper (Final Exam). The midterms aren't too easy or too difficult, and are graded objectively by a computer since they are MC. The professor is very clear and has some of the most interesting lectures. However, beware the final exam as you may be seriously disappointed since the T.A.'s grade your paper."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He is one of the best profs at lecturing; he is very clear about expectations for the midterms (class notes + textbook). Midterm 1 was on 5 chapters, Midterm 2 was on 8 chapters (all MC). Midterms were average difficulty, but the T.A.s grading the Final Exam (Essay based) are brutal (I don't hold that against the prof). Overall, not a bad choice."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,one of the easiest classes you can take. just do the assigned readings and go to the lectures and you will pass the midterms and the class. He cares about your grade he wants you to pass. the lectures are sooo fun and entertaining he likes to joke around. he's totally worth it!!!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"BEST PROF EVER!!!! Alvaro had super interesting lectures and made you laugh, I was actually so excited to go to class. I recommend every student take at least one class with him!!! He will make you work hard for exams but you will get the grade you deserve. If you are in crim or soc do whatever you can to take at least one class with Alvaro!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Alvaro always had interesting lectures. The only thing that bothered me was he tended to shut down student opinions that differed from his own. He's a funny guy, seems a bit conceded, likes to joke around with students. Exams are easy if you attend and listen in class. He relates material well to everyday life which keeps the class entertaining."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof. Alvaro is an excellent teacher. His lectures are lively, informative and entertaining. His exams reflect the lectures and the readings well. When doing the readings, keep in mind key terms and random facts that pop up. Also be sure to pay attention to extra information given in lecture. Go to class to get CDN stats as textbook is American."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He is an awesome prof and is hilarious. very entertaining during class, but he also teaches a lot and his class was a lot of writing. will deff try to get him next year"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"VERY entertaining prof. Always wanted to show up to class, because class was always fun. Easy marker and you do learn a lot in the course, not just about criminology. Would recommend"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"FIRE-CRACKER, TAKE HIS CLASS, KEEPS IT REAL, FUN AND ENGAGING."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Great prof. Love that he doesn't post his lecture notes online because his classes are a best. Great personality and humour. Tests are relevant to texts book and lecture notes. Highly recommend for crime students.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Awesome teacher! I love his class!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Take his classes if you just want to have a good time in the lectures.  It's incredible how well he facilitates interesting discussions with such a big class.  He is funny and generally a nice guy but he doesn't talk much outside of class.  I don't feel like I learned too much, but I only took the class as a fun elective anyways.  It's easy too..."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,take his class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Such a great professor! One of the funniest ones I have ever had. Made it worth the trip to get to class because he made everything so very interesting! Read your book and attend class and you're all set!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Good prof.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"I was worried about taking this class because I heard he was stuck up and the class was hard. However, that is not the case at all. He is kind of arrogant, but what do you expect from a young Prof who teaches CRIM and Policing. IF you READ the book and TAKE NOTES, you will do well. IF not, you won't. Quite simple"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,he always keeps you entertained
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"This was a great class, the prof lets you choose to write essay questions or answer m/c questions for all his exams. Which was great for me becuase I suck I at m/c. Really student friendly, I would take it agian."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Class was interesting enough.  The midterm and exam had nothing to do with the course. You honestly don't ever need to go to class, just memorize the textbook!  He is kinda a jerk, REALLY full of himself, and is quick to belittle students for incorrect answers.  Does encourage group nice discussions, so you definatley won't sleep through his class."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,hes a really funny teacher and likes to make class fun. he cares for his students and will take time to help them in anyway he can. most of the content on the exams were from the textbook; exams and assignments aren't hard just require you to study and effort. hes a good proff and even better guy.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Awesome class I would take another class with him anytime. Really explains the material and  wants to help his students do well
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Sam's a real nice guy, I asked him for a letter for a graduate school and he went out of his way to  help me out and who I should talk to. For a part-time prof he really does go out of his way more than the full-timers."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,really good prof
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,This prof is like a vaccuum. He doesn't do anything but suck.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Teacher is an ****!  Narrow minded and negative.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,great class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,great summer class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Great class, really strict through"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Sam Alvaro.. He's from Jane and Finch, Alvaro loves to pretend he's from a hard neighborhood, he'll frequently refer to Rexdale, Scarborough, etc.. tends to be incredibly pompous, you'll want to answer the questions he poses to the class, but his harsh responses actually discourage class discussion."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Nice suits!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,This guy makes you think
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,I am not a fan.  Totally conceited and unclear.  Exams poorly written and full of mistakes.  I didn't learn anything except how to suck up.  Thinks he is too cool for school.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,When writing his midterms it seemed as though i failed but i came out with a good mark.. he's very up to date on topics and tries to relate..  is very high on himself.  easy final exam if you read the text.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"This would make a great 3rd year course. Course overload! And he bu**ies his TAs - who were incompetant, particularly for the workload and extra help that WOULD HAVE been great!  Interesting material but get a real prof to teach it."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Knowledgeable, but can`t get beyond his arrogance. He is barely approachable and condescending towards students. FAR TOO MUCH work for a 1st year course (final ex based on 10 text chs, 13 reader + lecture material!) GIVE US A BREAK!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,What a waste of money and time. Presents irrelevant material in class.He seems to be more worried about impressing the students that teaching.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,His tests were horrible and on irrelevant material. He is rude and intimidating
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,Amazing teacher...always willing to help out..definitely knows his stuff!!!!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"he wears a leather jacket, what else can you say!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"works hard, relates well, recovers under challenge, very informed & experienced"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300E,"Great teach. Awesome lectures, makes me want to goto class"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1300S,"His youthfulness makes lectures interesting, but can be seen as immaturity. OK"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,"I took this as a summer course. Dr. Alvaro did not account for the fact that there was 1/4 of the time to complete the online discussion questions (5 questions, 1000 words each, worth a total of 10%). Because of the short amount of time, it seemed like a lot of work for not very much of our grade. The online M/C exams were a lot of ""who said what""."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,"Great professor, makes class super interesting and always tries to engage everyone in the discussions. Midterms and exam were taken online, but don't be fooled he asks questions about the most irrelevant/specific details from the readings."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,Professor Alvaro makes the class so much fun. He literally tries to relate to you in any aspect and is always joking around which usually makes a 3 hour class tolerable. He is also such a nice person. The most bless thing is that his midterms are all done online. He is a must take especially for any CRM or SOC classes!!!!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,"Best crim prof!! He makes 3 hour lectures go by really quick, sometimes makes cut it short to 2 hrs. He gives 2 midterms and a final take home paper. He's hilarious, caring and interactive with the students. He made the course really interesting! High recommend his class!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,"Professor Alvaro is a funny guy. He loves cracking jokes and getting a response from students. For the class itself, we had two MC midterms and one final paper. He will make you participate by calling you out. Every student is expected to have a name plate to facilitate this so if you hate talking in class, BEWARE! "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,Great prof. Explained concepts and created class discussion. Asks for qustions instead of just barreling through. comprehensive understanding of what he teaches.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM1500,"The class was super informative. He kept the class interesting using different types of media. He loves to joke around, great class but make sure your not the one pranked."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2106,"|Ummm. Ok, Duhhhhh..."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2303,How is this guy a teacher? Ottawa U's standards must be very low if this guy can be a Prof.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2303,"Horrible prof. who will do everything he can to make you feel stupid. Never availible, he is always ""out of town"" for whole week's so don't even bother looking for help."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2303,"Yuck, yuck and yuck! You soooo do not want to take this course with him. Couldn't even look at my face when I asked for help."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2303,"Absolutely brutal teacher. Wants work done ridiculously specific and makes everything seem harder then it is. Avoid this prof like the plauge, trust me on this!!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,"Professor goes on hour long tangents in class and then removes those tangents from the recorded lectures and he then turns his nigh on incomprehensible ramblings into testable content. Contradicts himself constantly, has horrible organization and you better memorize that textbook like gospel."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,I took both policing classes Alvaro teaches and I loved him. If you go to class and do the readings you will do well.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,I thought he was great! He makes some witty jokes now and then but overall he is very good! His tests are very fair and he is very understanding. As long as you study hard in his class you'll be fine :)
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,"I've taken a couple classes with Alvaro, and I love him! His lectures are always interesting and he is great at engaging the class. So long as you pay attention in class, take good notes and do the required readings there is no reason not to succeed. I definitely recommend taking any of his SOC or CRM classes!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,Great prof. All around nice guy and all tests are nice and easy. If you pay attention in class you'll do great.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,Great Proff! the only proff that really keeps me interested during a lecture! involves the students in discussion and is a really chill guy. Take his class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,"Great Prof. His lectures are interesting and they don't put me to sleep, which puts him ahead of most professors. He always conveys the information very effectively and he always keeps students engaged. It also helps that he very funny. And despite what people say, he really does care about students."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,"Best class ever. His TA, Keith, was beautiful."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,I want to have his babies!!! i love this prof....I want to marry him!!! Arrogant as HECk and i love it!! AAAAAAAND he has CHOPPS what else could a student ask for!!! LOVE HIM!!! MARRY ME SAM!!!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,This guy is a godsent compared to anyone else you're going to get. trust me.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,He's COOL
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,"What a fun prof, his classes are interesting, and his teaching style helps to encourage an interactive class environment. He can be domineering/overbearing in person. U of O students, take a class with him if you can."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2308,"If your a serious student who just wants to go to class and sit there quietly and learn boring crap then you won't like this class. If you are sick of that crap and want to enjoy class once in a while, HIGHLY recommend this prof, for pretty much any subject"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM2308,"Great guy!! Very funny, he'll embrarrass you, if you have already embrarrassed yourself with a not so intelligent comment. Lighten up, compared to some other profs it is nice to have a breath of freash air. Keep up the good work, Sammy!! Hope to see you soon!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM4304,"I've had this prof twice, and although he is definitely entertainment, the course structure is bogus.  He gave us way too many assignment, that were way too unclear, and even though the students kept on drilling him for explanation, they remained unclear.  If you are ok without clear expectations then giver - otherwise stear clear of sam."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM4313,The only professor I know that takes the time to talk everyone in the class about there work and provides useful comments.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRM4313,Avoid this professor at all costs.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRMSECT,"I am back and forth with this prof/course... The mid-term followed the 1st half of the course well, but the final was REALLY difficult I think.  I did all readings and missed 1 lecture; the readings can kick your butt as there is a lot of it. He is a good professor - I'm just unsure about how to be really successful in this course."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,CRMSOC,"I had this guy for 2 classes, and will take his class again just because they are that great. I will admit that I would do him in an instant too, great lectures tho. He kinda looks like the cop from Heroes, maybe not to you, but to me, yes. I'd so tap that in an instant. But it's not just looks, it's personality . Really interesting lectures too :)"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,GLOBALIZATION,sarcastic and rude. definately to be avoided
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,INTROCRIM,"Awesome professor, his views are very well thought out. Some lectures really opened my eyes to a new way of seeing the world. All in all, he's a truly inspirational professor."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,INTROTOCRIM,"Sam Alvaro does not seem too bright. His idea of a 'good rapport' with the class is trying to get them to admit what drugs they've tried and then saying: ""that's it? man, I've had students in my class before who've tried everything under the sun""...Sam, Sorry - you're not cool. Stop trying so hard."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,METHODS,This is a boring class Alvero made it intersting and  fun take it with him!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,POLICING,This was an awesome summer class. Sam really cares about this students and really kept us interested in the material even when it was boring. I would take another class with him anytime.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,POLICING,"great prof, interesting lectures, I'll still be talking about his class two years later!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,POLICING,"He is a horrible professor.  Is bitter about being too ignorant and an azzhole.  He flirts with women in his class and belittles them the next second, whatever suits his fancy at the time.  He is the most disgusting professor I have ever encountered and would avoid taking classes he is teaching."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,POLICING,"I did not enjoy this class, or the prof.  He is very high on himself, which makes a huge impact on the class.  He needs to work on his people skills, and realize that his students are people, not robots."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC,HEEEY SAMMY! if you're reading this i want to say that i loved social deviance and that i really wouldn't have gotten up at 8:30 monday mornings to go to any other class! i hope we meet again.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC,This guy's class is a lot of fun. It's interesting and definatly worth going to.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC,Good teacher for the class (deviance)
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I enjoyed this class however, I did not enjoy Dr. Alvaro. All of the Zoom sessions were just crazy discussions about things that had nothing to do with class - 3 hour long discussions. "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"A very humorous and hilarious professor,the lectures are very exciting and I benefited a lot. However, the exam is really difficult. Although all the questions are multiple choice, I feel that a lot of knowledge has not been taught, but it appeared in the midterm and Final exam.The exam content is very detailed!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"All material for exams come from his recorded videos, long articles, and the textbook. His lectures are a waste of time since he barely discusses all of the content during class time. His exams cover very specific details of his recorded videos and the textbook, they are not easy. Any prof is better than Alvaro, avoid him if you can."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I attended his lecture once in person and it genuinely made me cry. He is extremely condescending and confrontational, every chance he gets. He makes you have name plates for discussions during class, and then proceeds to butcher your name pronunciation anyways, regardless of if you correct him or not. TA's do everything for him. TA's are great."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Honestly one of the best profs i've had at UOttawa. He's absolutely hilarious and super fun! Attendance is definitely mandatory because classes a re not recorded. However, I had a 3 hour lecture with him every Thursday night and it flew by. He includes his students in discussion throughout the lecture and is very clear on material and assignments."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I liked the material but I did not like the professor. His live lectures were useless and he wouldn't talk about the actual material. His posted lectures are animated videos, which might seem stupid but they were actually entertaining. His exams were very specific and you needed to know every little detail about the readings and lectures."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,tests have nothing to do with what we were lectured on! stay away!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,professor alvaro is hard but fair in my opinion. there is a lot of material but he doesn't discuss any new matieral in the live lectures and they're kind of a waste of time. the tas weren't sociology students so they weren't much help for content related things. definitely not a bird course but still interesting
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"SOO condescending and acts likes he's the best prof (when he's definitely not )! Very very rude during class and when students are done talking he states ""are you done now "" AVOID at all costs and save yourselves..."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Amazing recorded lectures with fun animation in it. Reading the textbook is very important. He gave out two midterms.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"He didn't even give us lecture notes or powerpoint slides, so I basically had to write out everything he said during the lecture videos, which was extremely exhausting. Not only that, but he made one of the assignments due during Reading Week. Avoid this prof if you can."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Do NOT take him! His tests have literally nothing to do with the material he tells you to study! And he doesn't use his lecture time effectively at all! Also, he is condescending!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Great lecturer, great human being. Just his exams. I've never taken a worser exam in my life. Completely randomized textbooks questions. I studied for weeks prior, memorized nearly all the class notes & took extensive notes on the textbook. Still was never able to break an A. . Goodluck, you'll need it. And Trevor is a beauty of a TA."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,For all of you saying his midterms don't reflect the class material and are mainly from the textbook... get used to it in your upper year classes. Maybe that's why I wasn't so upset when I actually DID the readings and got an A- in the course. Teachers aren't going to just hand you material for you to memorize you have to work for it.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,He doesnt post his notes and has lots of discussions not related to course material. His tests are online but you have 50 minutes to answer 50 questions and they are hard. 5 discussions online and the TA is a hard grader with no helpful feedback. I regret BIG time taking this class as an elective. I would NEVER reccomend this class to anyone.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Hes a fun prof, and his lectures are discussion based. He doesnt post notesso make friends if you like to skip class. All exams are online, but theyre difficult. Read the textbook because most questions are from there."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"His lectures were amazing. He was super chill and was always listening to people's opinions. Class had an ""open discussion"" style which i liked. There were 5 discussions that you had to do during semester on brightspace (10%). The 2 midterms and final were ALL online (!!) You had 1 min to answer each Q. This was good for some, others not so much."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Dr Alvaro gets off topic A LOT but he makes class really fun by making connections with things his students can relate to. He doesnt post his slides so you have to go to class, has like 5 online discussions throughout the term. His exams are all online which is really nice bc u can put less emphasis on it. Textbook is so boring tho but necessary!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"BEST PROF EVER! enrol in his class if you get the chance, you wont' regret it. Hilarious lectures that make the info easy to remember. Midterms and final online really helped. Downfall is powerpoints aren't online."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Alvaro is a very engaging prof!! He made each lecture engaging every. single. time. Also the extra credit he gave for attendance (1% extra if you are in class when the attendance is 60%) helped me out a lot! The two midterms and final are online but BE CAREFUL because they are all multiple choice- its not as easy as it sounds!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Going to class was always fun. Super chill guy but serious about what he teaches. Always interesting discussion, lots of class participation. Cares about his students. He does get super peeved about talking during class though and will call people out."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Do not take this as an elective. This is not a bird class. I repeat. This is not a bird class.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Very nice prof! He makes class interesting! I love the class discussions. Make sure you do the readings and answer the textbook questions for extra practice!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"you have to come to class in order to get note because there is no another way, it really bothers me when keeps looking at his phone during the lecture, don't know what is so important about it. the first exam, assignment, and final exam are all online so it's pretty simple. you have to be a fast note taker because he will keep rushing you."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Uses a lot of immature humour, and likes to play ""guess what I'm thinking"" but overall, not bad.  Open book midterms/exams that can be done from home and an easy grader for written assignments.  Would recommend"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Great lecturer and funny, asks lots of questions in class so beware. Doesn't post anything on BB so go to class to take notes. One online open book midterm, one 5 page dbl spaced paper and online open book final, which can be done from home. Overall very interesting lectures but he won't allow talking and will call you out on it. Id recommend him."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Awesome prof, enjoyed going to his classes. Always cracking jokes and tries to make connections with the students. Explains material in a way that's easy to understand. Only thing is he doesn't post his slides on blackboard, so making friends is helpful for missed classes."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"If you are good at reading and self-study, take his lecture. A lots of notes in class require the strong hands because you have to write down everything on his ppt. He wouldn't post his class notes on Blackboard. His exams are open books and M/C, not very hard if you go over his class notes and the textbook."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Sam is hilarious and makes 8:30 lectures bearable. This course is an easy A. The first midterm and the final were online. I barely studied for either and did well on both. The second midterm is a paper which seemed to screw people over seeing as the class average was 66%, but other than that I would recommend this class!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Great engaging professor. Made 8:30am lectures very bearable to attend. Only negative is that his exams are multiple choice and involve some very random and specific questions! Get the textbook, you will need it for exams."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Lectures are fun and engaging
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"He's a hilarious prof who makes even 8:30 lecture interesting and engaging. I took his crim1300 course first semester and changed my electives to take his soc1101 for second semester. You have to attend every class to get the most of the class but the textbook is extremely helpful, he makes every class worth it to attend, and moulds to the class"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I really enjoyed Alvaro's teaching style. At first I was taken aback that he didn't put the slides up on Blackboard, but I think it really helped motivate me to concentrate. His lectures were interesting and very interactive. As long as you study and do the readings, you will get a good grade. Another plus: he typically ends class early."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Great prof, really interesting, but sometimes condescending and rude. He asks for students' questions and opinions, but rejects them and tries his best to disprove them. The exams are based on minute points from the readings and include details that are impossible to remember. If you do all of the readings and attend all lectures you'll be fine."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Always talking to students and making sure our questions are answered and concerns are addressed. He picks on people occasionally but if you are following the lecture it isn't an issue. He will publicly shame anyone who does something to piss him off (not following rules, cell phone goes off, etc) so behave! Does not post slides online."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"AWESOME PROF, ALWAYS KEPT CLASS ENGAGED. you can tell he's from Toronto by his sass, approachable, caring and really great at discussions. I'm in Health Sciences and this course was mandatory however he made it worth it, and writing essays and doing readings were not as bad as I thought they would be."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Alvaro kept the class interesting. Used a lot of videos to explain his points. Slides were very clear. Exams were somewhat easy, questions came from both slides and the textbook. Showing up to class is fairly important (he gave out bonus marks for attendance). Overall, no issue with this prof."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1104,"Very engaging lectures. Exams are multiple choice but they are VERY poorly made. It's either copy-pasted questions directly from the class slides (easy) or impossible questions from the textbook (insanely specific things that you can't possibly remember or questions that have two possible correct answers, but only one is ""right"" according to him)."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"He is not funny and people need to stop pretending he is. Ridiculously condescending, picks on students, and embarrasses them in class when they ask questions (which is really unfortunate for first-years who are adapting). Don't fall for the snapchat selfie. If you need help, ask a TA. They do all the work for him. Wish I had something nicer to say"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"This prof only uses Brightspace to evaluate students, including ALL of the exams. There were many technical difficulties throughout the semester with many students and he wouldnt help any of them. He would say to the entire class why dont you just CALL Brightspace? Do the readings or you wont pass. Avoid if you can."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"In spite of the fact that he is an amazing prof and his lectures are fun, his exams are all online but very tough. He gives about 120 questions and you just have a minute to answer each question. I would not take him if you have another option"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,Such a funny and amazing prof! The material is sometimes hard to understand so make sure you buy the book. Open to in class discussions and loves to hear your point of view.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"Lots of reading for this class but the lectures are just phenomenal! Alvaro is an amazing prof and you would love every single lecture. He is hilarious and is super engaging. He teaches real-world issues in such a comprehensive way, you just HAVE to take a class with him! All his exams are online and he truly cares about his students! TAKE IT!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"Lectures were interesting. However, exams rarely on the lectures, rather they focus on the 40+ page readings we had for each class. Does not give details on what themes etc to focus on while studying.. youre on your own to figure that out. made the class feel like a 4th year class simply because the majority were 4th year students."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"Very interesting lectures/movies, class discussions take up 98%. Discussions not on exams, therefore mostly readings on exams. I am in 2nd year and found the readings to be difficult, not 1st year material. Answers are not easily found in readings. Tricky MC exams. Will never take another class with Prof Alvaro."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,By far the worst prof I've had is far! What you are tested on on exams and tests are so random. His lectures are super interesting but who cares about an interesting prof if you can't get a good grade? WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,"This class was my only class this semester I actually looked forward to/enjoyed going to. He is always updated on current events as well as pop culture, and speaks to a very 'hip' and current/modern audience. Midterms and exams are online and straight multiple choice, which I found to be nice as you have your notes in front of you."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,"Very engaging prof as well as cares about his students. Your insight is valued and considered, and he is always trying to stay up to date in pop culture to make lectures relatable. He relies a lot on brightspace and all exams are done online but if you do not mind that I highly recommend him as a prof. Easily my favourite prof this semester"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,Prof Alvaro is very funny and makes sure to use lots of pop-culture references so we can better understand the subject matter - he even uses references SO current that the students don't even know about it yet. Make sure you attend every lecture since he doesn't post anything online and most discussion boards / projects have to do with the lectures
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2105,"Awesome lecturer! A lot of class involvement, if you do not like to be called out, then you probably shouldn't take this class as name plates are mandatory to make calling people out easier! Tons of readings all which are a huge part of exams, and they are very difficult! If you go to class and study you can get a good mark!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"2104* The content in this course is interesting, however, I find this prof very condescending to students who speak up and in many instances, inappropriate. He does not post the lecture slides anywhere and does not give any sort of exam review. Pay very close attention to the details in the readings because it will probably be on the midterm/exam."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,Avoid him if you can. There's so much reading to do in this class. The class is cumulative. He uses the class time to discuss the class content and answer questions which is fine. His midterms are 50 questions and gives you 50 min to answer them. He gives out discussion assignments and they are time consuming and worth like 5% at most
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,I would never take his classes ever again (I had 2 at the same time). Blogs were a lot of work (essay style) and were worth 2-4% per each. Exams were extremely hard with no time (50 mins per 50 questions) and did not include course content. Inappropriate topics and the TAs did all the work and I felt that they were under a lot of stress.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Although the class content is interesting, much of what is learned is never on the exams. This is further complicated by the fact that Alvaro is a lazy condescending prof who acts like a know it all but is unavailable to answer questions both in and outside class."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Tough class to do online. Reading is endless, he doesnt seem to care about most students. Talks about inappropriate topics, we had a survey about our sex life that was worth a portion of your grade so not really optional. Discussion assignments are worth 2-5% but are very time consuming. Avoid this class and the prof if possible."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"The class material is so easy and straightforward but prof Alvaro makes it so difficult. There are SO many readings, mainly articles and journals, and you are tested based on the smallest details from these readings. Lectures are useless, no class material is taught. Expectations for assignments/tests are non-existent so you get awful grades"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Worst prof Ive ever had avoid if possible!! Heavy textbook readings, articles then tested on the smallest details. Doesnt lecture, uses class time for discussion then brushes off all student concerns. Time consuming discussions worth almost nothing, TAs do all the work for him. I was constantly ignored when asking questions, extremely rude prof"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"God he's so bad at teaching. Doesn't show up to class half the time for no reason. Brushes off all complaints. Doesn't listen to students. Also cringy and pretentious. Tries really hard to be ""hip and cool"" but it doesn't work. Seriously though, he grades tough, doesn't give proper instructions on assignments, doesn't listen to student feedback."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"This prof has no idea what he's doing. He's one of those ""I want my class to appear hardcore and not easy!"" Content is easy. Prof will throw assignments at you left n right, grade you unfairly, with no rubric for you to go off of. Doesn't care what you say either won't listen. He's a legitimate piece of trash. Doesn't care about student wellbeing"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"He couldn't care less for his students. He puts up a front like he is super cool and chill and wants everyone to succeed. However, the large majority of his test questions come from textbook test banks. It's useless to study class notes. His rubrics are also very broad and unclear. Also very condescending when answering students questions. AVOID!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,good lecturer but lazy prof. His exams are computer generated so the questions come from random details in the text. Avoid him if you want an A
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"He makes classes interesting and fun. Midterms, assignments + final exam are all done online which is convenient. He is very interactive with students and calls on people randomly a lot which some people will like but it may not be your thing. Make sure to bring your nameplate to every class! He's more likely to call you out if you don't have it."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"His assigned reading and articles are actually enjoyable to read! Interesting and relevant topics. He keeps lectures fun and encourages participation. The atmosphere in his class is great, and rare. His tests are easy and relevant to what we have learned. I would definitely take another class with this prof! However,  his TA was not helpful."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"This teacher was a very very easy class. A funny teacher, but if you are actually wanting to learn, this class is a waste of your time. The teacher is a joke, and does not discuss anything relevant. He also does not know what he is talking about. This class was a waste of my time and money. I would not recommend it. Easy, but not worth it."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Favourite class and professor by far! Extremely engaging, gets to know names, very funny and up to date on everything. Lots of reading and midterms as well as final are very comprehensive but study and read and attend and you should be fine! Definitely recommend this class and prof to everyone! I would take this class again "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,Friggen love this guy. 
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Enthusiastic and engaging (and funny!) prof but the lectures are basically a vague recounting of the weeks reading. A lot of reading, both a textbook and a course reader and ALL are mandatory to pass. Weekly journals make sure of this. He does call on people and can tend to embarrass them so beware if you have anxiety about speaking in class. "
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"He is such a great professor, not matter what he teaches. I have had him for methods, intro and deviance awesome prof makes the material so interesting."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"He is such a great professor, not matter what he teaches. I have had him for methods, intro and deviance awesome prof makes the material so interesting."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,seemed to be disinterested much of the time.  Exam questions didn't always reflect what was taught in class (or what was in the book)
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"The course is great but Alvara is quite pompous and condescending.  I read the entire text, went to every class and studied everything, but i still found questions on the midterm and exam that i had no idea where they came from - i'd never seen them before.  It's an interesting class, but i wouldn't take another course with Alvaro."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"This guy should be teaching more classes at Ottawa U, he actually makes going to class worthwhile and is extremely interesting,class always goes by fast when he is teaching. His Multiple Choice is sometimes tricky,but it isn't too hard to get a good grade in his class as long as you show up for class and read the textbook"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"If you do well on MC exams, then you'll excel, but if you're not, I suggest choosing another course.  My other courses were MUCH harder and I received A's. I got a B in his class.  Writing the optional paper wouldn't have helped since most people did poorly on it as well.  The course material is very theoretical and uninspiring."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Best Prof at Ottawa U,this guy knows how to make class interesting. He's also very helpful.I would definetly recommend any classes he teaches."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"This was the best class I have ever had at university. Too bad this is my last year, I would take another class with Alvero anytime."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"I agree that he can seem cocky but he's a good teacher. He ALWAYS uses examples and really gets the class to participate. I disagree with people who say his class is hard...those people are just too lazy to study. C'mon, this isn't high school anymore! Study and you'll do fine and make sure to read the text book and DON'T do the essay, bad idea."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,I loved Sam! He was awesome! I'd take his class anyday!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,I had Sam last year and the year before. I'm a gradate student now at another university and there are only a handful of professors at the University of Ottawa that actually prepared me for graduate school. He was one. I didn't realize until this year how valuable he's classes were.  Love him or hate him he makes you thing about the material and ho
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"a jerk. doesn't answer questions with proof or arguments, just insults or jokes to get the dumb  kids in class to laugh. insults intelligent students by treating the entire class like first year  soc students (who all drop out) even though a class survey showed most of us were 4th years looking for an easy credit. read the text, memorize powerpoint"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Good class, very interesting. The mid-term and exam were multiple choice. You MUST read the text book or you will do horribly. The media analysis assignment was ok, but it was a little unclear what exactly he wanted. I would definably take another class with him."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Really interresting class... he is very good at keeping our attention on the material. The only problem with his class was the media analysis essay, he kept saying how great it would be and that everyone usually loves it but I absolutely hated writing it and found it to be really pointless. There is barely any direction as to how he wants it...."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,He's an ****.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"I enjoyed this class and professor. He was interesting and down to earth. Sure, he may have embaressed a few people, but we are all adults, have balls and suck it up!! He was the one who told me/our class about this site actually!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Really not a fan of this teacher.. he acts like he wants to help you but as soonn as you go to ask a question its like he doesnt have time for you.. absolutely horrible.. he thinks hes all high and mighty.. and that hes really funny, truth is hes not. He does get the material across but likes to pick on students."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,Everyone should take this class. He's a great prof. Really opens your eyes even when its 10 at nite
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,aweeeesome prof! i would definitely take another one of his classes again!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,A confident teacher but too full of himself. Seems to take pleasure in embarrassing students who offer up answers to questions. Often knows his topic but makes many mistakes and often gets off topic. He is chauvinistic & only pays attention to young girls. Class was interesting but his attitude detracted from it. Tests and paper were difficult too.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Wow. Interesting prof...if your definition of interesting is arrogance. Sure, he's funny at times, and encourages class discussions...probably because he doesn't have anything else to say. Oh yes, and if you're taking his class, you mustn't DARE ask any questions, because god forbid if you don't know the answer."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"good class, has some interesting points aside from his arrogant nature."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"very clear, easily approachable, lots of fun in class"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Was Okay, but very unclear"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,This guy is a total **** if you talk to him on a 1 on 1.  No people skills and poor interpersonal relations with his students.  Not fit to be in a leadership role at a post-secondary institution.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Can come of as arrogent, but presents material well. His youthfulness also helps"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Little arrogant, thinks he is the best prof. Cool guy, very hard tests"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"He makes you work for the grade thats for sure. But as long as you do ALL the readings and attend all the lectures and pay attention, youll do fine! For his online class, he used the live class time to do discussions and take questions. He sometimes comes off as lazy however. I think thats because his TAs do most of the work for the class."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"LOL, I just notice that he literally put a lot of PUA-related content in his lectures."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Exams barely reflect lecture content, if at all. Midterms are 50 questions in 50 minutes, including more than a few vignettes. It's also become apparent that he just uses a question bank since the last midterm, some people randomly also got 1-4 short answer questions others only multiples choice, and more than a few others had duplicate questions."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Avoid Avoid Avoid A lot of readings, unclear rubric for assignments or discussion boards, unclear instructions for exams, unclear and irrelevant questions in exams, chaotic gradings, literally wasting student's time, weird assignment topics. He literally gives everything to his TAs and not take any responsibilities."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Fun guy, but I'm lucky I only have one class with him. Don't take him if not necessary."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"This teacher doesn't care about the students. His exams are online that consist of 50 multiple choice questions. You only have 1 minute to answer each question. Lots of readings and no study guideline to the exams. His classes are usually 2-3 hours and he doesn't allow breaks, would not take a class with him again."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"AMAZING prof. Definitely my favourite sociology prof hands down. He makes class fun and something you look forward going to. Gets off topic sometimes but in a good way, he's an entertainer. Switched up my whole course timetable for next semester just so I could take another one of his classes again!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,Read a lot of the textbook and assigned article readings as most of the exam questions come from there. The class was definitely one of the most interesting and fun ones I've taken. 
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"This is my third time having him and he's by far one of the best professors at University of Ottawa. He doesn't sugar coat, and tells you how it is. Typically he doesn't do papers, and focuses a lot on the readings, but he's super fun, interactive and funny during class. I highly recommend him as a prof."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Took 2 classes with him. Very interesting prof. Makes you want to go to class, and you won't be bored while listening to him. Very dry humour at times (which can offend people, but i think its hilarious).. 3 total exams, mainly multiple choice. it was kind of hard at times. READING ARE MANDATORY; and heavy on reading materials (my only complaint).."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Both the first and second midterm were 60 questions, u will see some of the questions on the final. There are a few questions on the assigned reading, but mostly he relies on the book, with a little emphasis on class notes too. (book and notes overlap at times). Kinda rude though, I asked a question first thing he says is ""Are you in my class?""."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"forces you to pay attention out of fear that if he calls you out (which he will definitly do at some point) you won't have a clue what he's talking about, and he will pick on you for the rest of the semester...sounds cruel, but makes you pay attention...also a really chill dude"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,Great Professor! He makes class interesting and explains everything really well! Make sure your readings are prepared he likes to ask specific people!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Doesn't send out PowerPoints and while everyones busy scrambling to take the notes he asks us questions. :S And too concerned with getting us to like him. spent way way way too much time on the topic of dating, when there are other great topics we could have explored in social psych! he just thinks sex is the only thing students are interested in."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Sam ""The Man"" Alvaro! -- I took soc-psych with him. He is a very intelligent young professor and conveys the subject matter effectively; however, the exams can be challenging because it requires you to have complete knowledge of the book/CR/Lecs. Not only did i enjoy his class but I made a good friend. Recommend any class Sam is affiliated with!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2109A,"Very nice, fun, and clear. Funny, good environment."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2151,"I actively seek out this prof have taken multiple classes because hes amazing at lectures, funny, keeps the class interesting! and best of all (*for me at least) he doesn't do papers! he typically gives 2 midterms and a final, and sometimes 3 midterms and a final but I prefer tests to papers. Make sure you buy the text B, tests come from reading"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2151,Great class lots of class discussions.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2306,"If you need a bird class, take him. Multiple choice exams, straight forward. You probably won't learn much, most of the things we cover are things that you probably already know but hey we all need that easy to pass class! Doesn't post online so you have to go to class. You can try and find the texbook online or get an older version if you cant buy"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2306,"Great prof. Explains everything really well, so friendly and he makes class fun and interesting."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2309B,"Very well-humoured instructor. Greets everyone at the door, smiles and makes jokes frequently. Speaks clearly and loudly, emphasizes important theories and concepts. Powerpoints are detailed and important to take down. Go to class, participate, and DO YOUR READINGS. Easy pass and all around cool guy. Loved his class, will try to get him again"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC2312,Such a good class and you get the grade for the work you put in! Really reading heavy but the assignments are easy to do and thoughtfully spaced out. Lots of discussion in the class time. Prof Alvaro wants you to do well and the TA was so helpful. Loved this class!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3117,"He is arrogant, not willing to help, doesn't care about his students and seems like he is merely trying to make your life difficult for his own amusement. Intentionally made things more complicated than they actually are. If you completely ignore his advice on projets you will do well, as I did."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3117,"Probably the worst professor I've ever had.  He was so disinterested in what he was teaching that I found myself bored and unmotivated constantly.  His form of help consisted of telling me that I was floundering but that I wasn't ""dumb"".  He did not know what was on his own slides most of them time and gave poor examples in class."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3117,"For a methods summer class it was awesome. It was a ton of work, but Sam was always there to answer questions and help out when we got stuck. Great Prof!!!!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3118,He's a great professor! He has an intimidating personality but his jokes are hilarious. Lectures are a very BRIEF summary of the readings so make sure you read ALL of the readings CAREFULLY. Midterms and final are fair. Just don't miss class and do all the readings and take really good reading notes.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3330,"This was the best globalization class at OU. Prof Alvaro was awesome, he really opened my eyes to different aspects of globalization, not same stuff that all the other profs teach over and over."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3330,University would not have been the same without Sam!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3330,"Class was interesting and many good discussions/debates, but most of the material presented seemed totally irrelevant to globalization.  Funny guy and good prof, but should stick to criminology and deviance courses."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3330A,This is the kind of prof U of O is hiring? For God's sake people review this guy. There is not one student in the class that likes him or considers him to be a good prof.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC3331,"He is a good professor, passionate and interesting. He is intimidating however and often made fun of our responses. You MUST do the readings in order to succeed on the exams. He will take specific parts of the readings for questions, so you won't get by just by skimming them."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC4305,This guy is the epitome of academic wannabee. He is the most unprofessional professor at U of O. He flirts with women students makes **** comments talks incessantly about the Sopranos lets his TA's do all the real work has no office hours and if you make an appointment with him he doesn't show up.
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC4305,"This guy is laid back, takes the time to know his students"
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOC4310,awesome class
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOCA,"I find Sam's classes to be relatively easy. I've him twice now and I loved how both classes were strictly mulitple choice exams. You can pretty much show up and get by on them without attending class. When I did attend I thought he came across as a funny guy, not especially helpful though, as he tends to rip on a lot of students."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOCDEVIANCE,University would not have been the same without Sam!
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOCDEVIANCE,"Tough class, but 3 hour lectures flew by. Hilarious, encouraged class discussion, lot's of personal stories..would recommend this prof to anyone. Midterm and exam were m.c."
University of Ottawa,Sam Alvaro,SOCIALCHANGE,Great Prof
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,1109,"Satisfactory Professor. You must enjoy bio as much as he does to do well."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,1130,"Worst prof ever. If you want help from him, forget it. Very unreasonable. If you don't have that one word in a question that he wants you will get a 0. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,1130,"Incredible amount of material to memorize. It's more like two courses in one and the last bit is huge, so huge that he can't get through it all in class. All part of their plan to fail as many people as possible. Worst course ever so take it elsewhere if you can. Believe the rumours. It is just plain awful and not worth the unnecessary stress.  "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,1130,Very difficult midterm examinations. Crossword are a key to success.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,2012A1,"If you're looking to learn a lot, this prof is amazing for that. When it comes to getting marked he is TERRIBLE! He will tell you to define something, & you can write multiple correct answers, but he will only give you a mark if he FEELS like it. even worse the exam questions can be vague ex: Define eukaryote. you can easily get 0 marks.AVOID THIS"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,21253323,I like biology and took most of the bio courses. Dr. Houseman is an excellent prof. He is indeed the best prof in bio. But being the best teacher isn't everything. He has poor personality. Very mean and most of the time I think he doesn't want to see the success of his students (except for a few). He'll leave no legacy for U of O. What a shame!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO,"Excellent lecturer. He is very necessary for first and second year students. He knows what he's doing and he does it very well. Don't expect an easy A, he teaches fundamental biology courses which need your efforts. I am now doing reviews of my previous professors as I am entering my graduate school. He was one of the top teachers I had."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO0000,boring!!!!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO110,"He is very rude during office hours and extremely arrogant. He does not respect his students and is full of himself. Do not speak up in class, he will make fun of you. Go to lectures, and do the key terms, otherwise doing well on midterms is impossible. Crosswords are a must too."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1101,"He is a very good professor, very innovative approach to teaching. He records every lecture on a podcast so that you can listen to it again off of his website (he does not use virtual campus) however, dont assume that you can skip lecture. His exams are extremely difficult and usually are based on the lectures rather than the text."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1101,AWESOME!!!! Best prof at the University of Ottawa!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,"Ok proff, very knowledgable. The course is just to hard. You need to know a lot for the midterm. Too much material for one to know."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,"well i took his course and i did ok, i would have done alot better if i actually studied, but i have to say Mr.Houseman has got to be the smartest professor i have ever had, he knows everything!!He dosent even need to refer to the book, he can teach of the top of his head."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,"very knowledgeable prof, knows everything but oh so boooooooooring!!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,"Great professor, organized, very clear, helpful and friendly, concerned about his students."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,He is an excellent prof!!!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,"Provides lots of material , GREAT course website."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1109,A prof who CARES about students and teaching. What a concept. Take his courses.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Take notes (he's an amazing lecturer), do the readings, and make definitions for the keywords each week! don't fall behind with this, they're important. Study the keywords like mad and Do. The. Crosswords. If I could put it in bold type I would. DO THE CROSSWORDS. I had him again for Animal Form and Function and it's the same thing. I love him<3"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I remember only ever getting a perfect grade on one key word question... I think him and Katie Gilmour have to be the most demanding professors you will ever have (even worse than calc profs). Unless you are a robot or lucky enough to memorize things instantly, they set you up to fail. If you didn't 'succeed' in his class, don't take it to heart."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"At first, Houseman is not going to be a great professor until you adjust to how he teaches. Everything you need to know he'll talk about in the lectures. However, when he tells you to review his keywords, DON'T, there's just too many. Just write super clear notes for every lecture, and use his podcasts to fill in blanks."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Do not take his class if you're looking for a good grade. His grading criteria is extremely tough, he's looking for very specific answers. To pass this class I recommend going over the keywords thoroughly a long time before the midterm/exam."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Honestly the best prof
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Great lecturer but really really tough and strict when it comes to his marking schemes for midterms/exams
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I loved Houseman. You'll hear a lot of negative things about him, but he's a real gem, especially for first years. His lectures were engaging, and he has a way of just keeping the class' attention for the whole time he has. The class was very organized, he was very clear in what was expected. It is sad to see him retire."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great prof who is really passionate about his subject. Lectures are engaging and surprisingly interesting for a first year course. Midterms and final exam are hard because you are expected to know everything that was mentioned in class, but if you study early and take advantage of the resources that he provides then you'll be fine"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Class was really interesting, and lectures were engaging. Expects you to know absolutely everything."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Such a great lecturer! Hard exams but very little homework so makes it manageable to stay caught up with readings and reviewing lecture notes. Overall, I really enjoyed Houseman."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Funny guy. Lecture material is EXTREMELY BORING. Podcasts saved my life. Study early or else you will hate yourself. Answers to questions are extremely specific, so don't try to guess."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His website is incredible, he gives you -exactly- what you need to succeed in his class. He's not easy to talk to, at all, but his lectures are top notch. Be sure you know exactly what is going on, because if you word a definition or mechanism weird or incorrectly, it is wrong, he can be pretty specific that way."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I was in his last ever BIO1130 class, I leave this review as a relic for future uOttawa students who have dodged this bullet.  He's extremely pompous. It's like he knows that the material is not hard so he fills his midterms with trick questions so that you feel like it is. He uses long words just to confuse people but they're not used correctly."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman was the Prof I was warned about. Though his marking scheme is tremendously hard, I looked forward to his lectures. He is very knowledgeable in the subject, conveying the material in an effective matter. The course is very interesting, if you can take all the information in. There is a lot of work involved in studying but it is worth it"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"To pretty much summarize it, Houseman is an amazing professor, he really seems to love what he's doing and explains everything in his lectures detail by detail. BUT, his exams are the hardest things you will ever do in your entire life. You think you understand everything, and BOOM. Nope, you failed."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I was honestly very scared coming into this class because I heard so many bad things about him, but he is such a good professor who really knows his material and is passionate about what he is teaching. May be a little arrogant and all of the information tested is based on what he says word-for-word - so read his blurbs and pay attention in class!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The course he teaches is extremely complicated and FULL of information. His exams are also graded very strictly. However, he has MANY resources on his website that make the learning extremely effective. If you put the effort in and use his resources effectively you will learn a ton and do well! His lectures are great and interesting and he's funny!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"By far the worst prof ever at uottawa, and the course shouldnt even be mandatory, it should be an elective!! Dont take this prof!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Hated him then changed my mind after BIO1140. Very good lecturer, clear and precise. THE KEY TO DOING WELL IS: go to class cuz the podcasts are really boring to get through, write WORD FOR WORD notes, watch podcasts before exams to touch up notes, memorize crosswords for exams, and redo past midterms. Don't buy the textbooks. BLESS THE BELL CURVE"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Good lecturer just very difficult for incoming first year students to adapt to. Puts in a lot of effort in his study materials. USE HIS CROSSWORDS:15-20 marks per exams are word for word the crosswords. Key words are stressed but there's so many they're more a time waster than anything. Need to study and work really hard to do well but it pays off
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Houseman can be unforgiving but he is a fantastic lecturer. The key to doing well in any of his courses is writing down every word he says like a transcript and using that to study. He does give you lots of resources to succeed and expects his students to use them. He always adds 0.7% to your final grade and bell curves the exams.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Horrible teacher. I literally switched programs for the sole reason to not have to retake this class. There is just WAYYY too much to study to be able to do well, especially for first year. Over half the class failed my year and he ""did us the favour"" to bell so that only HALF the class failed. Test are so hard"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE TAUGHT BIO1140?!?!!?!?!?
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Worst prof ever..... he doesn't emphasize which info is important and what is not and considering he doesn't have words on the powerpoint you have to take everything he says as something of essence to only get screwed over on the marking scheme and surprise questions that he said wouldn't be on the exam...
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is one of the best profs I've had. His tests are really detailed and you need to study for them. If you don't study you're unlikely to pass, but just a little bit of studying and you're good. He explains the material really well, but you have to be in class to benefit because not all of it is caught on the podcast."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Never had a prof so generous with marks like houseman i mean theres profs that give you a big bump up one time in your life but houseman every midterm and the final. dont speak up in class tho as he'll embarrass you lool but other then that i thought the course was really easyyy just memorizeee the podcasts!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His lectures are very informative and he is very good at keeping the students attention for the 80 minutes he has. His marking scheme is very tough. Make sure you do the cross word puzzles, usually those are on the exams. Study off of the lecture slides and only study the key words found in the lecture slides. He's pretty hilarious sometimes."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"cherish this prof while you can. While there is a ton of material and you will find yourself crying before the midterms and exam, he provides you with all the resources you need and his midterms are not a surprise if you studied hard for them, you'll miss him once you get to second semester biology lol."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Lectures are v organized, online blurbs reinforce concepts, txtbook readings give you extra examples and the crosswords basically hand you 20 free marks when it comes to midterms/final. First midterm is tricky bc you might not understand his grading till you see what you did wrong. PODCASTS. Didnt go to any lectures after reading week, & did fine."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Everyone will tell you to be afraid of him, but don't listen. He has clear, funny, engaging lectures and provides you with a ton of resources for studying. He will do his best to help you succeed, but he's not going to hand it to you on a silver platter. Go to class and do the crosswords and you will do just fine."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The key to doing well in this class is studying material from a variety of sources: his lectures/rewatching podcasts, the crosswords, the blurbs on his website, and the textbook. It's a lot of work, but manageable if you start early. Labs and quizzes are mark boosters. The prof is a good lecturer and is very knowledgable, but can be condescending."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Very entertaining and was always looking forward to the next joke he was going to say. I always went to class and would have to re-watch the podcasts for every class because there is so much material and so much said that you dont have enough time to write or type it all down. DO THE CROSSWORDS. Word for word fill in the blanks are on the tests.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Worst experience of my life. There is so much material packed into one course and learning 750 keyword definions for the final was an impossible task even though. I started studying the moment we got the materials but no matter how much I studied it was just a lot. Avoid at all costs or you're in for the most stressful 4 months of your life.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Good class!  Very well organized!  Prof gives you all the material you need to succeed, just takes time to make use of it all.  Do the crosswords, they show up as the fill in the blank questions on the midterms and finals!  Stay on top of material all along, don't leave it till the last day. Only take this class if you have to, not a good elective!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"It was a really tough class, a lot of content and the midterms and exam were difficult. He is a great lecturer though, very dynamic. The whole class is very well organized, use the resources available to you. There are podcasts but they don't replace going to class."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He's a good talker. Lectures are fun to attend. He gives you a lot of material to prepare you for his exams. Make sure you watch the podcasts 2-3 times before every exam and make notes. Attend the class; things stick more easily that way. Do only the keywords you think you have no idea about.  His midterms were hard but the final was okayish
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"OKayyyy we might as well get settled in and get started. Fair class. Put in the work, get the grade you want."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Amazing prof! His lectures are super interesting and he teaches the material really well. His exams are a bit tough, but as long as you understand the material (and go to class) they shouldn't be bad! Make sure to use the resources he provides on his website, they're super helpful."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"You definitely have to put in effort for this class. There are A LOT of concepts and keywords to memorize and understand. Doing the crosswords is a must, and always study as soon as you can because things will accumulate very quickly. He is a pretty good prof, but his marking scheme can be very annoying. However, it is possible to do well."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I think the problem with this course is it was not interesting for me personally. The first two midterms, the concepts were more likable (personally), but once we got into zoology, yeah no. Do the keywords, watch podcasts, DO CROSSWORDS. Good lecturer, boring class and he is condescending so that doesn't help. Best of luck!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Not as bad as people say he is. Don't ask questions if he already said it. Entertaining classes. Great lecturer. Watch the podcasts, don't rely on them. Keywords are helpful, there are 3 points for each keyword on the exams. Do and memorize the crosswords, they are used in the fill in the blank on the exams. Textbook is not very useful but can be."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Anything he mentions in class is fair game for midterms/finals. Is intimidating and gets annoyed easily when you ask questions, so I'd suggest referring to the text first if you can. GREAT lecturer though; very easy to understand. For keywords, focus on the crosswords and words related to those; don't just memorize each keyword individually."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Must go to class omg do not depend on the podcast. I relied on him posting it online, and I cried for the whole 16 hours I spent before the final exam watching all the lectures I missed. Just go to class and do the crossword."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Dr Houseman's lectures were long but they could be interesting if you stay focused. Take notes for every single sentence he says in his lectures since his exams are basely mainly on what he talks about in class and the keywords/crosswords. Don't waste your money on the textbooks; you can get an A+ without them as long as you attend the lectures.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman is a great lecturer, but is so cynical. Don't ask him a question in class or he'll make fun of you. He's a hard prof and is so picky when it comes to writing answers, but if you have to take him then make sure you have time to study for his class and prioritize it. If you can take this class in French then do so."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Let's settle in and start this review. Houseman is a great lecturer; his class is always interesting to listen to (unless it's the 3 hours on plants). The tests are difficult as there are many keywords to learn and only a few are really tested on in full. The labs for the class are great and they help your average. Best of luck!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"You will learn a lot in this class. Do the crosswords (memorize them), do readings if you need  to solidify a concept, look @ old exams b/c he often repeats his mc. Keywords are the stupidest things but you must do them, just to be sure you know them all. He'll give you HUNDREDS for one exam and only test you on like, 5. LOL. Pretty funny though"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Bad power points, often unclear, a total ass when people ask questions, likes making questions about seemingly minor concepts. Pretty impossible to do well but if you want to try - do readings before class, do the keywords, rewatch podcasts, start studying ages before the exam. Messed up marking scheme, hard exams-@ least he bell curves. AVOID!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Awful,  no matter how long you study for get ready to fail. Tests are based on the most unrelevant keywords. Lecture notes are very unclear, his powerpoint are pictures and you have to do your own research. There are a million key words that he expects you to do. Never want to have another course with him."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Lots of material was covered. Found that memorization was valued over understanding (though he says otherwise). Make sure you do the crosswords! At least 20 pts of each test are drawn from them,  word for word."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Memorize his crosswords, they're given marks. Don't expect to get any marks for definitions or long answer questions unless you used the exact words he was looking for. Don't ask questions or answer questions in class, he's a good lecturer but he's mean and will put you down. He thinks he's above everyone..."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Keys to A+: 1. Completely dissect his podcasts and take notes on EVERY detail 2. Memorize those notes 3. Do crosswords (free marks!) 4. Look at keywords to make sure you know them all, but DO NOT waste time writing notes for them. Everyone studies differently, but there's a very specific way to succeed w/ Houseman and this is what worked for me."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I found Jon Houseman to be a great lecturer. His course covers a lot of material, but he conveys it well and is a very captivating speaker. I found the lectures very interesting. The exams are tough though. There is always a couple curveballs on them. Also, don't buy his book Digital Diversity. Waste of money, never opened it once. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman provides excellent tools to ensure that you can learn the material. Lectures are recorded online, and he gives crosswords and summaries as well as textbook readings. The amount of material is huge but if you put enough work in, it's doable. Houseman can often be condescending, but the course is mandatory."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Good prof. Has really good lectures and he knows his material really well. His marking scheme is tough and you need to work hard, but you learn a lot."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Honestly if you want to do good in his class, watch the podcasts and take detailed notes as if you are writing a script. Memorize these notes. Also do the cross words!! You can pass the midterms by just doing the crosswords alone. Find as much previous midterms as you can and do those questions, since he reuses them  "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Good lecturer. You must study off of what he says in class so take really good notes. Terrible human. Not approachable and very impersonal. 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Honestly the hardest cause I've taken in university, he gives an unbelievable amount of key words which are not of any use as the exam questions are centred around very specific details which only had one slide and maybe 1 minute of lecture time on. Good luck."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's my favourite prof in my first semester of university. He's a great lecturer, but incredibly hard marker. Be ready to study and memorize. He's not the greatest person, personality-wise, and he is sometimes pretty rude. However, he's really funny, and he does care a tiny bit about your success. Do the keywords and the crosswords. DO THEM."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Gotta study
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He's a great lecturer and he knows his stuff. But the class is very difficult for a first year class. Don't take it as an elective for the love of all that is good. Do the crosswords and try to understand all the key terms if you want to do well.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Worst teacher I've ever had. This is coming from a guy with straight As. That terrible excuse of a prof got me my first B.  ALSO, digidiv is WASTE OF MONEY. DO NOT BUY IT!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"It's not that he's tough, it's more that there's a lot of material to cover. You NEED to keep up with and review everything in a timely fashion. The little details matter. Making study groups will definitely help for his class.  Also: he makes crosswords. THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY FREE POINTS ON TESTS. Make sure you do them for practice. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Treat the details of the course content like you would when reading a novel, it's much easier that way to retain information and to really understand keywords. If you can't make a lecture, podcasts are super helpful. They can be slowed down to half speed to REEEALLY understand some of the tougher concepts! Prof can be harsh, take notes VERBATIM. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Take detailed notes (word per word) on what he says in class. His marking scheme is pretty tough. Be ready to memorize. I didn't make a keywords  list but rather studied the material like a story. good lecturer though! 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I think that his terrible personality is what I disliked most about him. He is cold, sarcastic, and has humiliated people in front of the class before if they did not use the quieter door to enter the lecture hall (especially if late to class in doing so). The 2 midterms and exam were not as difficult as they were vague in the questions they asked."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He integrates student comments and short videos to make lectures more interesting. He's a good lecturer but a brutal marker. He will call you out on your stupidity if you answer a question stupidly and the only person that enjoys the course content is Houseman himself. He makes you buy Digidiv which is an online site for 2nd half and it's trash.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,At least he bell curves.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I loved Houseman's class! Lots of people complain about his marking, which, granted is tough, but I found it to be quite fair. Really funny guy, made lectures interesting with jokes and funny videos. I never touched the textbook or keywords, just did his crosswords and reviewed my notes, and came out with a decent grade. 1010 would take again. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Definitely not an easy professor; his midterms definitely require practice, you should definitely go to the lectures, and read the textbook. However, he has a lot of resources to give you the practice he needs, the lectures are interesting, and are also recorded. So even though it's not easy, it is fun. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman knows his stuff (passionate about bio.).  Must watch podcasts at least twice before exams.  SPLIT keywords with a friend.  DO the crosswords.  Read his online extra resources.  Takes notes in class wt a laptop. Marking scheme is totally unfair and tough.  If that's a deal breaker for you, take equivalent of class in french if you can"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Everyone complains about Jon Houseman but he is really not that bad once you get used to his teaching style. He puts up podcasts of the lectures which are helpful. Re-watch them and make notes on everything he says beside the slide and you're sure to ace the class. Also, do the keywords! Pretty good lecturer. Be sure to work hard!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I have a lovehate thing with this prof. His exams are marked very harshly but if you study properly you should do well! Mutiple choice questions are from old exams and the crosswords. Fill in the blanks are all in the crosswords. Short answer questions are the keywords. Long answer questions are the hardest; incorporate keywords and be exact. 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"At the time I took this class I thought he was a brutal prof, but looking back now I know that if I had actually put in a little more effort, this class was an easy A. His tests were basically regurgitating his notes, there were no  ""trivial"" or think hard questions.  So if you want to do well, do the crosswords, listen to podcasts, and memorize!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,His lectures were very boring and his exams were impossible. Over 200 students were failing his class and that just goes to show how horrible of a teacher he is. Would definitely not recommend.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"This dude is a terrible professor. If you ask for feedback he will just make you do the crosswords to learn terms, even if that wasn't your problem. Do everything you can to avoid him."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A clear cut memorization class. His tests are all from his classes or readings he specifically said to read. If you put off studying until a few days before  count on a D or a C. All in all, he's not the worst prof I've ever had although it felt that way when I was in his class. Do the readings, re-watch the lectures, you'll be fine."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"After having two classes with him, the best advice I can give is to memorize everything. Use the keywords in your answers, go to classes, listen to podcasts or record lectures and listen to them again and read the book. Take very detailed notes and answer test questions exactly how he would answer it (based on the lectures). Did I mention memorize?"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,he is only nice when he adds 10% to everyone's marks and u never know when he will do that. don't go to his office hours because he just spends his time telling you to go read the textbook or tell you to go figure it urself. Inconsistent in marking. Doesn't give marks on exams even though u wrote literally the same thing as his marking grid. 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"OMG rude rudre rude. not impossible to get a good grade unless you have 4 other classes, or not even. just work hard for it. he scarred me for life i don't want to do bio anymore. I'm taking bio1140 and scared to death thanks to him "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is a very tough grader.  Unless you have houseman's brain OR happen to be a mind reader OR just-so-happen to study the questions he asks, you will do terribly on that section. Unfortunately for you, he is the only prof at uOttawa who teaches the course, so if you decide to go here, prepare to study like you've never studied before."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Okay so here's the deal. The way he teaches it makes it an extremely tough first year class. The way that he goes over the notes in class makes it hard to connect the dots. And truth is unless you study specifically it is really hard to get above a B. It isn't impossible no, but with ambiguous study techniques you will need to put in A LOT of work."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"""Worst prof save yourself attend another university"" The same comment already exists in our records for this professor, so please enter new comment."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Worst prof take it at another university please save yourself!!!!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Okay lets get settled in, get started. Houseman has a lot of rumours surrounding him but he is a good guy. It is crystal clear how hard his course is and he tells you in his course guide. A word of caution, key words are only part of the deal. You need to read and re-watch his lectures because otherwise you will suffer. Enough Said. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Is in love with himself and his own voice. Labs and homework are easy. Hard marker as he is very specific, and there is a large volume of material in the course to cover and it's not clear what and what not is important. It defaults to 'everything I say is important'.   Podcasts are the most useful. Passing the class is not too hard. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is an amazing lecturer, but his midterms and final are brutal. Do not focus on the keywords, but make sure you do the crosswords, it will help you on the fill-in-the-blank. Almost all of the answers to his assignments are online. Go over the podcasts and remember to work smart, not hard!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Brutal marker, unless you can read his mind you will get no marks on short answer, so to do well you need to get every multiple choice and fill in the blank correct. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Amazing lecturer! However, he is not very helpful outside class. Fill in the blanks are taken from his Crosswords. Keywords help with definitions but DON'T FOCUS ON IT; they're NOT everything. Focus instead on making sense of all the info given to you; organize them into your head like one big story; this will definitely help for long answers"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Interesting class but he acts like a jerk when people ask questions and promotes himself too much. Incredibly tough marker, you have to get the precise words he wants or you get zero. Labs and assignments are easy but tests are tough. Wouldn't recommend."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Terrible marking scheme !!!!!!  He only looks for specific word and it doesn't not matter if you have explained it and wrote as much as you could to clear your point. He searches for that specific stupid word! 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Yes, Houseman is a tough grader and his marking scheme is extremely specific BUT he is a phenomenal lecturer and will teach you 95% of what you need in class.  Tips to succeed: make notes primarily from the podcastslectures, do crosswords a couple times (free marks!), and only do the keywords that you don't know. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I generally have a good memory and can memorize lots and I've heard that this class was all memorization. Houseman goes into so much detail on so many things and only tests us on a small portion of the material and expects us to remember it all. There were also over 400 key words on the final (which wasn't cumulative)
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's not as bad as people claim. Yea he;s tough with his midterms and exams but if you really make good use of all the resources he gives you and actually put in the effort for the big work load, then a good mark is manageable! focusing on HIS explanations for key concepts worked best for me since he basically decides what the ""correct"" answer is. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Yes, what everyone says is true. Houseman is TOUGH. However, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Split your keywords up with friends, do the crosswords, fill in your notes with the podcasts and you'll be fine. This class is a lot of work, and the final is definitely overwhelming so do well on your labs, midterms and assignments. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,he is a big no no but you have no choice because he is the only one who teaches this course. Most pickiest and toughest marker! Go to his lectures and listen to his prodcasts BUT google and yahoo answers helped me out way more than he did so don't depend on his ridiculous digital diversity and dont memorize the key words understand his lectures!!! 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The material is really interesting, but his class made me dislike bio. I really liked biology in high school. He is rude and it seems like he is constantly trying to promote himself and how ""great"" he is. The tests are somewhat fair but he only accepts answers if they're worded EXACTLY how he'd word them. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"In the past I've had teachers who I didn't learn a ton from during class, so I was ready. However, it seems like its really difficult to do that, since there aren't a ton of clear resources you can use. Considering how huge the textbook is, I was hoping it'd be more resourceful, and his book, 'digi div', which he just promotes like a new mix tape."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I have never in my life felt like such a failure. He's very rude and don't try to ask him a question cuz he will make fun of you. Don't take this class unless you have to. Too much material try your best on labs and assignments. You have to basically speak ""his language"" or you fail, if you don't write exactly what he THINKS is right,then its wrong"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"First thing: this guy is an ass. He will cut you off midsentence to make fun of you. Next, he really knows what he is talking about. Good lectures. But that doesn't really matter, he is incredibly unclear as to what he wants you to know, and if on tests you have a right answer but not his, you get no points."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Although the course seems alright at first, it becomes increasingly difficult. Midterms are primarily based of his online crossword puzzles rather than the lectures... HE is extremely difficult to understand in terms of language use. No direction, and a lot of information to know. Good luck to anyone who has to take this his course... "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Do well on  midterms and labs cause there is way too much information to study for the final which he does not even mention in his lectures. Don't take this class if  you are not required to
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is an ok lecturer who gives you the slideshows to annotate beforehand, the issue being that anything out of his mouth is considered testable, yet at least half of the exam content has never been touched in class. Need to work through the mountain of readings and keywords  crosswords to hope to pass this very information dense class."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"It's hard to study for this course because he dumbs everything down so much during the lecture, but expects so much on the tests. The marking scheme is ridiculously specific, and part marks are difficult to get. He's super sassy. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is proud to show people that he is smarter then you. Doesnt give part mark, he want a perfect answer. Usually the highest range of grade is E and F. But, he like to take these two category out to do the class average, so it's not under 55%. wouldnt take that class if it wasn't needed."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman gives interesting lectures, although they feel long. He is well organized and gives decent feedback, even though he is a hard (but fair) marker. He really wants students to succeed and is interested in good teaching methods and suggests many different methods for studying including vocab lists with crosswords and interactive diagrams."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The rumours are true! He is indeed a tough grader. If you do not like organismal bio, you won't be liking this course one bit. The labs help boast your grade, and he does bell curve the midterms. He gives lots of resources (if you have the time) to do well. He is funny during the lectures but a little intimidating outside of class."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Might as well get settled in and get started on this review. Great lecturer. but very long as well. Main issue is with his tests. The questions themselves are very fair, but his marking scheme is too specific for an information based course. Even if the answer is correct, if it was not in his marking scheme, you won't get any marks for it."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"- Gives Great Lectures, be prepared to type notes.  - Midterms are challenging, multiple choice is pretty much eenie-meenie-miney-mo game - Don't bother asking him for help, he won't even look at you or cut you off mid-sentence to make fun of you - Grading is horrible, expect B.S points taken off - keywordscrosswords help - Not recommended "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Like any first year class, you'll need to do a lot of adjusting. My advice, try to go to every lecture, go over each podcast a couple of times before the midterm and screw the keywords. Unless you plan on staying ontop of it the whole semester and splitting it up, just give up and memorize the crosswords. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Tough class
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Like any Science course you will have to work for a good grade but all tests and exams are fair despite the large amount if content. Not an extremely approachable professor but not bad to speak to one on one when you have a specific question.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"YOU WILL NOT PASS THIS COURSE IF ALL YOU DO IS GO TO CLASS AND READ THROUGH YOUR LECTURE NOTES. HOUSEMAN IS A HORRIBLE PROF. HIS MARKING SCHEMES ARE VERY SPECIFIC. VERBATIM IS NECESSARY TO SUCCEED ON TESTS. NO LEARNING TRULY HAPPENS IN HIS CLASS. GOOD LUCK IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS, OTHERWISE, DO NOT TAKE IT FOR FUN BECAUSE YOU WILL REGRET IT."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman, without a doubt, is a great speaker; however, the content on the exams, and his marking schemes, are unfair. Exams are full of questions which have little to no relevance or importance to the topics he covers in class, and his marking scheme is so specific that you can't get an answer right unless it is verbatim to what he thinks is right"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,worst prof so far
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"This class is tough but really interesting. Show up ready to listen and take good notes. Houseman has a class website with great resources for you to use. He has set this class up to be challenging, but has made great effort to provide everything for you to succeed. You just need to take responsibility and put the work in. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,If you make it through the rest of university is easy.  
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is an amazing lecturer, you definitely will not fall asleep in his lectures. But he is a legendary hard marker, expect really low averages. He is nice enough to slightly bell curve midterm marks, but he really could care less whether you fail or pass his class. I definitely suggest re watching pod casts and memorizing what he says!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great prof. Taking another of his courses for sure. Really funny guy, and gives a lot of chances to get a good grade. "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Basically, houseman has great lectures and he's pretty helpful. The lectures are hilarious but cover almost nothing on the exam. So you MUSTS READ THE TEXTBOOKS. And also, A REAL MID-TERM KILLER!!!! He has tons of keywords, which you have to remember because they will definitely appear on the exams. Mid-terms feel like filling up a dictionary.  "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Everyone keeps saying memorize the keywords... Don't! It's pretty easy to deduce which key words will be on the midterm based on how much he talks about certain things in class. If you try to memorize you will learn nothing. There are HUNDREDS of key words. Not worth it to try to memorize em all. DO the crosswords though, he reuses clues on tests!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"'Okay, let's all get ourselves settled in and get started!' This is the line that will be imprinted into your brains after watching the podcasts. Overall, a really heavy workload, midterms are killer, but in all fairness, Dr. Houseman provides us with pretty much every and any resource we will need for this course on his website. Too many keywords!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"TBH the podcasts do have their benefits, but they make u lazy to attend class and u end up watching them the night before the midterm absorb so much info. THe amount of material u need to know is RIDICULOUS! He is a very picky marker but everything on an exam has been covered. Expect to be a B or C student if u start studying 2 days before an exam."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A lot of the time i would attend his lectures and something would sound not quite right, after further research it turns out he was over simplifying and giving incorrect info. This course is not for those who like to understand rather for those that just memorize everything and regurgitate. Hated this class despite interest in the topic."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,A true intellectual. An amazing lecturer and educator. Other professors should attend his class to see what impeccable teaching looks like. His class is a lot of work but it's simple - work hard = you will be rewarded with a good grade. Very interesting course especially for a first year class. Dr. Houseman makes it's absolutely worthwhile.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is a great lecturer. He gives lots of chances, especially with his fill in the blank that you can get the answers from his crossword. The exam is very difficult so try and do as best on the midterms as you can't. This is not the easiest course but he isn't a mean guy the course is just hard and people tend to not study."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Awesome website! Sassy but I loved his quirky ways. He was quite funny and entertaining. Lots of material to cover, very interesting! Do the crosswords and reading on his website. Don't stress to much about the keywords, use them to test yourself."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,BEST PROF EVER(BEING SARCASTIC)
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Do the key words and crosswords. Don't leave the keywords till the end = bad idea. Do the reading on his site they are helpful for exams. Do the past midterms, many m/c are repeated. Not a hard class to pass if u understand the material he discussed in lectures. Podcasts are very helpful to reviews material. Not as scary as people say"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman is a really great prof. He keeps the material interesting and he is quite entertaining. He's a great lecturer but the course is quite a lot of work. Make sure you stay on top of notes , don't fall behind. DO THE CROSSWORDS AND KEYWORDS! Review the podcasts. He tends to drop off marks on midterms to improve the class average. Good luck!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Interesting lecturer, but a rather hard grader and midterms/final is incredibly hard. 1/3 of the course (of ~1000 students) failed, with a grade under 50%. Not normal if you ask me. Lectures and podcasts help A LOT."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Excellent lecturer! Assignments are infrequent and easy, just google the questions. Labs are stupid easy. Midterms/final were challenging. Do crosswords and you're good for MC + fillintheblank, but for definitions and long answer, you need to guess what key points he wants you to say. Do keywords well in advance. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Overall a really good prof, he's a really good lecturer and makes his lectures fun. Sometimes, he strays from the topic but other than that, a great prof! I found him somewhat picky in his marking scheme for midterms and finals but if you study hard, you can do well. Crosswords help a lot. I didn't use the textbook even once during the semester."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Easily the best lecturer I've had since starting here. He's pretty arrogant (especially speaking to him one on one), but as a teacher at the front of the class he was great. Interesting lectures, material, and funny lil stories. Don't piss him off, he'll rip you a new one in front of the whole class. Textbook, crosswords, and keywords all helpful!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The best lecturer in first year, also the hardest class in first year... If you can get through this, you can get through any other first year course. Wasted $150 on the textbook, never opened it. Re-watch lectures. For midterms & final I just mastered keywords and crosswords. Midterm 1 class average: 59 Midterm 2: 54 Goodluck!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"very precise and great lecturer. He can be a bit picky with tests, but nothing to worry over. Do the crosswords over again and keywords, everything will be okay."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman has a terrible rep at uOttawa, but I'm not really sure why. Yes, he has difficult tests and midterms and there is a lot of work to do in order to do well in the course, but that would be the case regardless of who the prof was. I found him to be quite approachable and helpful and he gives you access to everything you need to do well."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The tools that he provides are quite useful. I loved that he had podcasts if you missed class. Like others said, do the keywords/crosswords. Those two things will help you greatly on the midterms/final. The concepts are not complicated and he makes the class interesting. Textbook was not used but you may need it for BIO1140."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,A good lecturer with some really difficult midterms/finals. He rushed the material near the end though.  Read up on the material beforehand or after class or you'll be bogged down by the amount of material he goes through. He also can't spell to save his life so his keywords/crosswords have all sorts of errors.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great professor, amazing teaching tools, and can make lectures very interesting. The amount of effort he has put into the course is outstanding. Tests are tough but with the correct studying they can be done well. Don't buy the text book, not used at all."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman knows his biology and he can teach. Explains things well and his website is very useful. That being said, the amount of information you're required to learn takes away from the learning experience. Pure memorization. Also, he's the most anal marker you'll ever encounter!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Don't even bother asking him anything. Pretty good presenter though. Don't buy the book, nobody uses it. Such a waste."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"""Okay, we might as well get ourselves settled in and get started"" is all that will truly sick in your mind. Just kidding, it is a great course and Houseman does a great job explaining all the key points. Its a lot of material so it moves quickly but just do the crosswords before examples and its easy to figure out the key points to study."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"This guy is obsessed with bugs..Has pretty intersting lectures Def should rewatch the lectures,"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"HIS MIDTERMS ARE BRUTAL, BUT HIS LECTURES ARE VERY IMPORTANT."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A very good lecturer, I'd say definitly go through his podcasts (it will save alot of time!!) instead of searching all over the internet for keywords (his lectures explain them well enough), also his lectures explain other concepts so podcasts are very key** make sure get everyword in class !! because his Tests are specific/difficult **"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I found the class to be super interesting! He's a tough prof with lots of material, but trust me when I say this, its not impossible to do well. As long as you stay on top of the reading he assigns (which I highly recommend), and go to class prepared you'll do fine. His midterms and exam were hard but very fair."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Amazing lecturer, always captivating and keeps interest high.  Midterms and Finals were a little tough, very specific marking schemes, which detracted from the overall course, but as a prof, very good and engaging."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"One of the best lecturers first year. He is very clear with his notes. His crosswords and previous exams are extremely useful as he recycles all his questions. Don't just look at the previous midterms he posted on his site, google his name to find more. His midterms and finals are tough but he does bell-curve the midterms and NOT the final."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His class was okay. But when it comes to the midterms and final....it sucks! He is a very hard marker which makes it very hard to get a good mark in this course. Read the powerpoints, DO THE KEYWORDS, and look over the podcasts. Need to know everything from top to botom if you want to do well in this class. WORK HARD!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"What I considered one of the most demanding first year science classes. You have to memorize a lot of the things he mentions in class. Everything on the exams/midterms can be deduced purely from the knowledge from  lectures. Lecture info > textbook info. Keyterms are rediculous. Even if you know them, chances are you will only get 2/3 for your def."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"This course is difficult, especially if you're aiming for A's. Professor Houseman is very comprehensible and an excellent lecturer. The midterms and final exam were unfair, in the marking aspect; we had to mention very specific things to earn the points. Keywords are essential. Do the crosswords before midterms and final exam. Good luck :)"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"One of my favourite classes of my first semester at University, inspiring me to become a Biology major. Houseman is an amazing lecturer and you MUST take good notes during class in order to do well in the course. Midterms and final were fair. The material is very interesting but there is a lot so don't fall behind!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great lecturer, really knows the content and material... sometimes a little too well, in the case of the midterm content.  Make sure to set aside plenty of study time before the midterms and final, he's very nitpicky on long answer and definitions.  Overall, very enjoyable class."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great lecturer with a dry sense of humour who really knows what he's talking about. I liked him! Condescending on occasion (okay, most of the time), but as long as you don't ask stupid questions and use the resources he gives you, BIO1130 is not THAT bad. The midterms do focus on very specific things, however, so start early and memorize!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Good lecturer. Yes, there's a ton of material, but there's nothing on the exam he didn't cover in a lecture UNLESS it's on a crossword. I've never seen a keyword on the exams that he didn't go over in class. Do the crosswords, and memorize the keywords he expounded on in class (and make your definitions using your class notes), and you'll do fine."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Probably the best lecturer I will ever have; really knows his stuff. You may think the course content is easy, but make sure you know everything before the exams. Exams seemed to focus on specific topics instead of the overall concepts, forcing you to memorize everything. Marking scheme is VERY rigid, don't be surprised if you do poorly on them."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is extremely knowledgeable, and very passionate about what he teaches. He is one of the best lecturers I have had in my four years at uO. He is very blunt, but if you ask a reasonable question, he is more than willing to help. Do the assignments, and the crosswords. All of these are major midterm hints!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Although his midterms are tough, he does give a fairly large amount of hints for them. After the first midterm you will learn how to study for his tests. He is actually a really good professor and is very passionate about what he teaches. Assignments are REALLY easy! Just study lots and you will do fine."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,ugh brutal that is all...
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He was very interesting and knowledgable. The course is easy to get a good mark in as long as you take good notes in class and do the crosswords he posts online. He could be a bit rude at times but was an excellent prof as far as teaching the content is concened.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Some good qualities as a prof (good explanations, online resources), but many bad qualities. Contradicts himself, and is very condescending, in class as well as if you try to talk to him out of class. His marking scheme is very specific. His spelling is atrocious, which I found distracting, and it makes his condescension all the more annoying."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Can't believe I had to pay $124 for the e-book, just because the 4 homework assignments were only accessible through there. Be prepared to memorize about 50+ pages of keywords for each midterm+exam, with 3 specific points for every keyword (you kind of have to predict which points he's looking for btw, otherwise you're doomed).Avoid asking him Q's."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I find him arrogant and unhelpful. Don't take his course if you don't have to. I cannot stress it enough!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A great professor. People who complain about how his exams are not ""based"" the lecture just don't know how to study at all. I didn't get a particularly good mark because I didn't study the right way. His exams are very fair and he has little summaries and textbook readings on his website that are extremely helpful."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I'd be more interested in this course in 20 years when the material is more absolute.He tells you exactly what you need to do to succeed and gave us generous bell curves on both of the midterms. Look at the past midterms because a fair amount is recycled from year to year. I liked the Dr. Houseman but not the course.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Pros: amazing organization, he has been researching teaching to large classes for the past 10 years, clear, humorous, podcasts available if class was missed, crosswords and keywords. However he is really rigid in his marking. This is not a class you can start studying for the night before an exam."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Hard prof, but if you pay attention and do ALL keywords, relate them to slides and textbook, you will do good!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"If you do not have to take this course, DO NOT TAKE IT! He is the hardest marker I have ever met."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great prof, may be tough but hes extremely knowledgeable in what he does. So organized too!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr.Houseman is very knowledgeable, however he has the most RIGID marking I've ever seen (midterms,assignments,and labs). It is totally unfair considering that there could be many plausible answers to a question, but you have to somehow know what key points he wants you to write to get the marks.. Lots of memorization.Crosswards are your life saver!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"So he can be mean and not very well-liked by many people, but what you can't deny is that he is a GREAT prof. Extremely clear, informative, and interesting lectures. It is a lot of work - do the crosswords, the readings he wrote himself on his site, keywords, and go over his lectures and it actually isn't too hard to do well in his class"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Lots of material to cover. He is totally a condescending jerk. Don't talk to him unless you absolutely have to. His exams   are quite comprehensive and you basically have to memorize every single thing learnt in that class to do well...
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The exam marking schemes are rigid, which is standard for a biology course. What's even more annoying are the lab marking schemes, those are even more rigid and the TA's are very picky about marks. Decent professor, but he can be condescending (IMO)."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I was very disappointed with this class. I found dr. Houseman to be unpleasant and unengaged. The exams were graded extremely harshly and when I had questions, dr. houseman seemed resentful and annoyed. I did not enjoy this class, and would not recommend it to anyone."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Of all the profs I've had at this university, he's provided the most study tools and tips to help the students do well. As a prof, he definitely knows his stuff. Having said that, he's probably one of the most arrogant people I've ever seen. Not approachable at all, nor is he very helpful when you request to see him. Very rigid with marks."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is the BEST prof, really cares about the class and tries to make it interesting (little jokes, sarcastic comments and videos). In both midterms he gave us extra marks (once by mistake and the other to help us out) but the course itself is really hard. Go to CLASS, do the KEYWORDS, practice the CROSSWORDS, and READ the TEXTBOOK."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Excellent prof! The lectures are good, he keeps it interesting. Do all the keywords,cengage quizzes and crosswords, listen to the podcasts and do the readings. This course takes effort! Favourite prof so far!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Have a look at the keywords before each lecture and look out for them in the lectures. Go to class!! Then make time to watch the podcasts and write EVERY word he says. Even if it's listening to the podcasts on the bus while reading over his blurbs do some bio every school day. He makes bio enjoyable but make no mistake this is NOT a bird course.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Amazing lecturer. Go to class, don't skip because podcasts are online- use them as a study tool. Crosswords, Cengage quizzes & some keywords are all you need for studying along with lecture review. Exams are really fair if you STAY ON TOP of everything. One of the best profs at UO. Interesting, clear & fair. Takes a while to answer questions though"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"DO THE CROSSWORDS, also his practice exams on cengage is very helpful. His exams are very fair and he's willing to bellcurve the exam. Very enjoyable course"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Although he does come off arrogant/intimidating, the course itself is very well made. The crosswords are used as fill in blanks on his tests, the MCs from previous tests are reused, and the podcasts are sweet, so use all of them. Reading the textbook is not necessary to ace the midterms/exam, but the material is not pure memorization and it is hard"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Podcasts are a God sent! If you're willing to keep on top of them you really don't have to bother going to class. Just make sure you write down every word the man says! It helped me so much. I didn't start doing it until the exam and I really wish I had have started earlier. Unless you have time, don't bother with keywords or the text book."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great lecturer, but I despise the exams"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is pretty fair in the end. Answers your questions, has good classes. Good overall effort. Midterms were harder than the final"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Excellent guy. Kinda mean sometimes but overall is a great teacher, he can TEACH. I highly suggest attending the lectures and watching every single podcast, hearing the material twice helps lock it in. Keywords... not mandatory if you know your stuff. TAKE NOTES, his lectures give the perfect info needed, didn't even need to used the text book."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Very good prof. Very organized and definitely gives you the tools to succeed. This is not an easy class but the work load isnt too bad. All you really need to do is study for the midterms and the finals. You need to study well though.He`s a little mean but i guess thats necessary if you`re teaching 1100 students...
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is an awesome prof! Make sure you attend the lectures, and listen to the podcasts to make better notes. There are a million keywords, and aren't necessary if you know the material. If you actually listen to lectures the midterms and final reflected what is covered."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's a really sick prof, very cool and makes great lectures. He's one of the most organized. His Mid Terms to some degree are challenging, but if you put the effort in then you will receive a good grade. Everything is online on his site, and he makes crosswords,podcasts, and the sort to really help the students learn. Amazing prof."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Not a bad prof at all, sometimes misleading whether information is relevant. If you want a good mark deffinatly need to invest some time."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's a great prof, very engaging, and can be hilarious at times. I highly recommend going to his lectures because it helps make the connections to other concepts you're going to learn about. Use his podcasts for studying only!! If you want a good mark, then you'll have to invest time and effort into it consistently."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Professor Houseman is one of my favourite profs.  His exams aren't easy, but knowing the material is your own responsibility, not his.  Do the readings, do the keywords, do the crosswords, and do the past midterms/exams. Basically, just know Organismal Biology so well that you can connect many concepts together."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's a good teacher, but he makes the exams really hard to make up for the fact that the course content is really easy. If you read the keywords and do the crosswords, you should be fine. He's a little monotone. zgood luck!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"""If we can get ourselves settled in and organized""  - Dr. Jon Houseman ;) lol Amazing prof, study hard for the midterms though!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"As a prof, he's the best of the best! Lectures are kept interesting, he speaks with enthusiasm, and really explains things well. It is ESSENTIAL that you study and review the material often - you learn A LOT in this course and it can get overwhelming! Very strict marker on midterms & exams. Study, understand the material, and you should do well."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Professor Houseman's has a great sense of humour when teaching. He provides many resources, and it is your choice as a student to take them or not. Make sure to write notes logically, that way it's easier to review after."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"One of the best professors I've had so far. Clear, concise expectations, amazing use of resources, will answer majority of questions asked in class and exams are fair. You must study to do well but he gives you all the resources needed to do so. Interesting and extremely knowledgable. Only prof to teach this class but I highly recommend him anyway."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He gives you so many tools to succeed! All the lectures are tapped and available online, he provides readings for things not sufficiently covered, key words for each unit... the class can be very hard, but everything is there for you. Though he is not very approachable for help at all... Pro tip: DO THE CROSSWORDS AND REVIEW QUIZZES!!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great professor. His personality is irrelevant. Perfect use of resources, interesting lectures, and his exams are very fair IF YOU STUDY."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He's a great prof and keeps the class interesting! Keywords and Crosswords that's all! GO TO CLASS!!!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"One of the best professors I have had so far! Knows how to keep the class interesting. Very arrogant so I would suggest not asking questions during class. Questions on the tests and exams are EXTREMELY straight forward, like ""what is background extinction."" Keep up on the crosswords and keywords and you'll be golden."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's arrogant and a jerk in general (if you attend his classes, he'll try his best to make you look stupid if he gets you to answer something or if you ask a question), especially in year 2011 when he called out an anonymous email ""rant"" and when he made fun of someone losing his lunchbox. Requires too much memorization (badly designed course)"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He is extremely arrogant. It is very unbecoming.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He wasn't that bad as a prof. He explained things pretty clear and was organized. He warns you that you must do the crosswords, and that's no joke. DO THE CROSSWORDS and you should be okay. It's true that he has a bit of an arrogant tone to his personality, but overall, not bad. Better than the profs who currently teach BIO1140."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Keeps the class interested, but thats about it. Midterms and exams are horrible as hes anal about the marking. Most arrogant prof I've ever come across."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Avoid this class if you can. It's not fun. The only good thing about Houseman is his ability to capture your interest. He's pompous, and his tests are ridiculous. You have to memorize 3 points for about 250 key words for each midterm. The points you write for each key word must be identical to what he put on the answer key. It's like family feud"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,All I have to say is I just don't get why this prof is considered average and yet Katie Gilmour another bio prof is rated above average. I think thats messed up. I can barely saty awake in Dr. Gilmore's class and in Houseman's class he captures your intrest. Houseman is a much better prof.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"course was very boring to me because i didnt see the sense in studying about all those eras and eons that ""supposedly"" happened.course is very tough but material is ok. there is over a million keywords to memorize along with some funny crosswords. mark scheme is usually quite rigid so difficult to get marks. have to notes in class under pressure"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Speaks well during lectures. Sentence structures in notes and exams are poor. Pure memorization of trivia. Memorize crossword answers. Define as many keywords as you can. Funny remark by him: ""Aww...he lost his lunch box!!"""
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"There were a lot of interesting concepts in this class, unfortunately Houseman doesn't ask for any of them on the test. In fact, his tests don't really ask student to think, reason, or evaluate anything...the whole course is just one giant test of how many keywords you can memorize. Also, the labs are a rip-off, I can't beleieve I paid for them."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Decent prof when it comes to the lectures. Fairly clear and interesting to listen to but he is an arrogant little man. Exams are more about specifics and not about concepts which makes them difficult if you don't study keywords and crosswords.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"very very difficult and anal, but really knows his****"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Very good at explaining, but VERY hard marker. You have to somehow know the EXACT answers he's looking for in an exam/midterm, even given his vague questions. MUST do the crosswords- they'll save your ass. Also, be prepared to study extremely hard for an average mark."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"explains the material in a  good form, but his exams are very hard"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I would never take this course again and would suggest you stay clear of this guy.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is very intelligent in the subject matter, and it really shows through his arrogance.Do yourself a favour and don't ask stupid questions or he'll make fun of you in class of 400 students. His exam's are fair, if you do the crosswords and key terms you'll be fine! He also has podcasts that were sooooo useful."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman explains concepts well, and can be an engaging professor. However, the workload for this course is horrendous, and to do semi well in the course you better go into the exam prepared, because the questions on the exams are very specific, and marks are easily lost. Be prepared to get 15% lower than usual in this course."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Very arrogant, if you ask a question, expect to be ridiculed in front of a very large auditorium. Too many keywords to learn, and he only tests on a few of them anyway. You think the midterm is going to be easy, until you get in there and it's entirely different material. Not a very good class, but there's no one else to it. Good luck everyone!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Use the crosswords! Try to attend as many lectures as possible or make sure you listen to his podcasts! His exams are hard but they're really fair. It is easy to guess what topics he will use for short answer based on the material. I only needed to use the text before the final.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His midterms/final are very hard and very specific! He gives us huge lists of key words, DO THEM (before the night before the exam) and DO THE CROSSWORDS! He gets behind in lectures a lot, which means he glazes over topics towards to end so you don't really know about exam material"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Terrible prof, it seems like he only comes to class to let everyone know how smart he is and how stupid you are. Dont bother asking him a question, he'll only make fun of you in front of 400 students. His test are ridiculous as he expects you to know hundreds of keywords and asks you about 3 of them. Bad professor, bad person. DO THE CROSSWORDS"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Hes a nice prof, his very good at lectures. He jokes around somtimes, though he also has problems. Almost all that talking he spends time in class does not cover midterm material. His midterms are 90-95% based on KEYTERMS, and he doens't warn us of this. You have to figure this out by the time you get shot in his midterms."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His lectures are interesting, and he's good at teaching but he expects too much out of first years. He makes it A LOT harder than it should be, and fails at helping the transition between high school to University science. His midterms are so specific, and the marking is picky. Despite all the memorization you attempt to do, it's more on luck."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I think it's time to retire.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"very interesting lectures and tries his best to be funny. midterms kind of hard and precise. has affairs with ta's. seems kind of mean but can't say for sure because i never tried to approach him. replies e-mail. forces you do buy a textbook and makes profit from it (if you don't buy, it, you lose 10% of mark)."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,This prof made me dislike organismal biology more than I did before. Inconsistency with lecture topics and midterm content. Also wastes time in lectures. not sure what people see in him to be honest.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Anyone who says hes arrogant, or obnoxious is wrong. Don't get me wrong hes sarcastic but he is always joking and does know exactly what he is talking about. He is my favourite and the best teacher I have had, his crosswords are key, all his online resources are brilliant, and he is one of the few professors that seems to be able to incorporate tec"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,If anyone thinks this prof is great - he does!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"lol, don't take this course as an elective. *eyeroll* what was i thinking! yes, he's very condescending, but he knows what he's talking about. i dropped the course because it was WAY more work than i had anticipated. on the bright side, he does give you a lot of resources!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's not very approachable, and a bit of a snob, but otherwise he is a very clear and comprihensible professor. Exams focus on key words, and less on concepts, but he provides all of them, and crossword puzzles to study from."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He was a fantastic prof! Definitely arrogant like everyone has mentioned but his class is easy and yet interesting. Do your work, and especially Crosswords. No reason why anyone should have less than an A in this class"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The best i can say about this prof is that i am happy i will never have to have him again. Man, talk about arrogent."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,i agre with the last student. Tried to talk to him twice but he insulted me both times so nevr went back.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,arrrrgh! worst teacher this year. thats all i have too say
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A great professor. Dr. Houseman's lectures are great, very interesting and funny. He can be intimidating and demeaning when students ask questions in class though. He must not check his website material for typos and bad grammar, which is irritating when you can't figure out how a keyword is actually spelt. Go to the lectures and do the crosswords."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,memorize and regurgitate and you will get at least an A. Professor is very full of himself. I learned next to nothing that I will remember.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Didnt really expect to like organismal bio very much, but he definitely makes it interesting. Fair midterms...exam multiple choice were pretty bad though. DO CROSSWORDS!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"worst professor and thus worst prof I have EVER had.  I loved biology before I took this course now I hate it.  Gives you a thousand keywords and expects you to know three definitions for each, then asks you about 4 of them on the exam.  RIDICULOUS!!! Literally a matter of luck.  Not a nice person and not a good professor."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is thorough, clear, straightforward. Very funny videos. Midterms and exam: no surprises;prepares u very well. B nice to him, and he'll b nice to u. Dont ask silly questions-youre wasting time, and making a fool of urself. start studying early for midterm. DO CROSSWORDS! pay attention in class, his powerpts are just keywords. best first yr prof!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,how sad that students give a teacher a good score if their course is really easy. I will get a high mark in this course but learned next to nothing of value.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"he is an amazing prof. 10 out of 10 for excellent teaching skills, biology without him is nothing, take him its an EASY EASY EASY A+. this class will bump up your GPA. midterms and exams are a breeze"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is a beauty. His lectures are thorough, his humour is hilarious, and he is actually quite nice. Do the keywords and they encompass everything he teaches. There is a reason why he won all those awards. I wish every professor was as dedicated to teaching as him. And he's cute. Fantastic professor, a priviledge to learn from him!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Fantastic. Podcasts are amazing! Prof isn't frightening if you speak one on one with him. Very funny, very clear, very good! Mean to his TA though. Do key words and crosswords!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He shouldn`t make an environment where student is intimidated from learning. There are plenty of keywords to remember, and the specificity of an answer for the words is beyond expectation. All 1st year science courses at Carleton have podcasts. This isn`t special."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is fantastic. His midterm was very clear and if you did what he said, you should have done well. And helpfulness? Honestly people, how many other professors put on their lectures so you can re-listen? I haven't had one yet. However, I am not a first year and I have bio knowledge, but be grateful for being able to be taught by one of the best."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Like every one says, he is very egotistical. When it comes to answering a student`s question (whether in class/office), he answers without clarity and intends to make the student sound stupid. Notes wise he is good but c`mon prof, don`t you want your students to acknowledge how great of a prof u are. Indeed you chose to be a prof, & we are ur futur"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"As a person he's not that great, as a prof, he IS great. He teaches his material with detail and makes it interesting as well. You'll want to mostly study the textbook and later on add in extra info provided in the lectures (there's quite a bit of extra actually). Dont ask questions in class, he doesn't really answer it and is rude while doing it."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman reminds me soo much of Tim Gunn from Project Runway! Houseman is kind of full of himself, looks down upon others sometimes... but has interesting lectures. He is very articulate, organized, and knows his stuff."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Ditto with the last student. This guy seems to detest students. Yikes!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's a really bad prof. Doesn't convey material well, and teaches it as if u already know everything, when u don't. Lecture notes are useless, they're just pictures and a few random words. Midterms and exam really hard. Maybe it's just BIO1130 that he's bad at. But he isn't friendly either. Labs are boring, lab exam is pretty easy if u study."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"An awesome prof. True he's a a** but a professor does not need to be the nicest person. Teaches very well, knows his material and his midterms and exams are very fair. You must go to class to do well and do the crosswords! answers to all of the fill in the blanks"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I found professor Houseman to be a good educator. I found his voice clear and his lectures interesting, most of the time. He used videos and brainstorming activities to keep us interested and he took class opinion poles. Although professor Houseman did seem somewhat rude when I went to see him about a mixup on my midterm, he is good at his job."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Awesome Prof. Just listen to the lectures! I studied the text book for the first midterm - did horrible. Studied the lectures for 2nd midterm and final - did amazingly well. Everything is clear - and his website is amazing!!! all the info you will ever need to know about the course. Not sure about the in class participation activities tho... :S
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Lots of resources. So many keywords to know, but he only tests you on about 5 terms out of about 100 he wants you to know!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"This was the FIRST bio course I have ever taken (even including grades 11 and 12) and while my initial thoughts were that it was going to be hard, it soon turned into and easy-avg course. I enjoyed his style of teaching and while taking notes is VERY tedious during his lectures, the midterms and final are fair enough. oh, and... DO THE CROSSWORDS"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is an excellent professor. I don't know why he got a lot of bad ratings. He made it easier for me during the course because of his variety of resources (Topics, lectures, crosswords,key words, CROSSWORDS). He is just excellent for an introductory course like bio1130."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Worst prof ever. Gives us pages of notes to study and puts three very random, very specific terms in his definitions. Don't take this class, go to the French section even if you don't know French."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Interesting lectures and provides many resources. However, like others have said, his midterms can be difficult and based on memorizing facts, no thinking required. Almost as if he just opened his book and chose topics at random. Can be challenging to get a decent grade, but it's possible."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"LOL hes a celebrity.. Anywho, It is impossible to take notes in his class(just talks and talks).. you probably will need to listen to his podcasts quite a few times. The midterms are impossible. He wants everything specific. And he didn't let us use a calculator to calculate Hardy-Weinberg Principle on the midterm! .... DO THE CROSSWORDS!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Loved lectures... he's interesting to listen to and learn from. However thats all ull love. Hate everything else: hate the course, hate the midterm probably will hate the final. DONT ASK QUESTIONS unless you really want to be embarrassed. He has unrealistic expectations of students on midterms. DO THE CROSSWORDS. gud luck to all of u that have him"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,his midterms are impossible! he expects specific answers for definitions that no normal human being can figure. the only thing that will save you are the crosswords.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A 4th year course not suppose to be harder then a 4th year course right wrong with houseman what you see is what you get.This prof is useless , first of all he's not qualified to teach biology is not his specialty and he's teaching the course second of he would make a better comedian then a teacher because thats the type of audience he caters to."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Hot TA!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The dude acts like he knows everything and his midterms are rough. The questions don't make sense and the detail he expects has nothing to do with the question. Dont bother asking questions during lectures - its for ur own good, he will wreck u. Do the crosswords and at least he puts up podcasts-> props for that."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He gives us a lot of resources online, which is very helpful, and posts the readings recommended. The only problem is that his midterm questions are much too difficult."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He doesn't seem to care for students he does. The students opinions matter to him, and he provides you with many ressources to study from, when a midterm comes around but masteringbio is all you need."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great teaching style and swagger. His clarity while he teaching is amazing, but i wish i could say the same for his tests. He knows his material, and isn't afraid to show off or embarrass you if you challenge him. He's proud and has reason to with his accomplishments he talks about every class which is annoying, but even though he doesn't seem to c"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Rude, thinks he is the best prof the university has ever had,but isn't! His test questions are not specific, but he expects specific answers. Memorize everything he says. No need to read the book just memorize his lectures!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's a great prof, he makes the material interesting, but his tests are hard! His long answer questions are not clear in what he's asking for, and he asks for specifics. The tests aren't a good judge of how much material you know, but more on whether you understand his question or not."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,omg i studied so hard and i thought i did pretty well but omg marked definitions so hard. why isn't anyone else teaching this course?
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Memorize, memorize, memorize. Don't think and you will do well!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He means business. He knows his stuff. He has great learning tools. He is extremely rude.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Houseman is a terrible prof. He think he knows way more than he actually does and ends up teaching quite a few incorrect or incomplete things to students. He bases his exams straight off of keyword (and random fact) memorisation. He is very rude when approached and did not follow his own netiquette in a response email to me. He cannot spellproperly
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I've read through these reviews that a lot of people consider Houseman to be a ""mean"" man, and I have yet to see anything of the sort.  His lectures are intriguing, he always inserts video clips (my particular favorite was the giraffe fight), and he breaks tension/boredom with his fun brainstorming activities and humor. Do the reading, you'll live."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Yikes! One lecture and I already wish I did not have this teacher. I am switching to the french section.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1130A,"Dr. Houseman is awesome! Sure, he can be pretty scary to approach one-on-one, but he puts A LOT of effort into teaching. He's engaging; his website is very helpful, and the podcasts are a god send. I'm not the biggest fan of the exam format, but everything else 100% makes up for it. Take his class; he'll be your best 1st year professor, guaranteed."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1131,Best prof
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1131,"Very interesting and entertaining lectures, I loved going to class...but I hated writings the tests. Tests were so specific and it felt like you had to know exactly what he was thinking in order to do well. They weren't impossible but you really need to know your keywords...all of them. Labs were kinda boring but not much work."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO113O,The legendary Jon Houseman was the best lecturer I've had so far!  He is very knowledgeable about what he teaches.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO113O,"The man is a brilliant lecturer, however he gets super sassy if you ask stupid questions. If it's not a well thought out Q, he'll just sass you out. His tests were okay, but a lot of the time the definition questions were about things he mentioned like once, briefly in a lecture. On tests do fill in blanks 1st, then MC, then Defs, then Long Answers"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO113O,Hardest prof. I really tried for this class and didn't do very well. Brought down my average a lot but I guess that's what is expected first year. He really likes the subject but calls out people a lot. Be aware. And studying 20 hours isn't gonna get you the marks you have to be a genius!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO113O,he is very though grader 
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1140,"He's an amazing teacher, but the marking is really tough. Know 3 points about each keyword, they really come in handy, Go through the podcasts as a review tool, and make notes from it, final exam had 2 questions that he only talked about in the podcasts and was not in the text or on digital diversity. Go through digidiv readings, they help."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1140,Professor Houseman is a very good lecturer who knows the material he presents extremely well. His expectations for students were clear. The only negative thing about his way of teaching was that he put up over a hundred keywords but we only got tested on three of them.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO130,"Not my favourite class, but it wasn't too bad. Make sure to take good notes and pay attention. Do the keywords/crosswords but don't spend forever on them... some do appear on midterms/the final but theres A LOT of words. Midterm and final were pretty easy if you took good notes and reviewed key points/ideas."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1311,"He makes sure to explain things, and you can understand him unlike other profs. H provides alot of study tool which is awesome. Funny guy, but arrogant. He will not hesitate to make fun of stupid questions asked in class, and he has SO MANY key terms. practice midterms and crosswords are word for word on exam"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,Extremely ambiguous exams and midterms. Almost as if expected to mind read what he wants you to say. The lectures are very clear and podcasts are always available. ( Beware of times where he shuts off the recording to mess with people that don't show up to class) Make sure you read the webpages on each of the lectures thoroughly!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,"Midtermsfinals are killer. You'll have to memorize all keywords and read the online notes and the ones you made in class and do the crosswords and glance at the extra resources he throws at you. Even then, your good grade is not guaranteed.   You have to force yourself to pay attention in his  class too; he talks in such a monotone."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,"Great lecturer - but talks too fast, hard to take down notes. Podcasts help with the missed information but make sure to take the important notes IN class. Keywords are a pain, should start them early but to study - should go through the ppwts in order and memorize the keywords as you progress. Split up the keywords. Midterms & exams are tough."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,"Awesome prof, explains if you have questions that aren't stupid. If they are, he'll tear you apart. Hilarious, but you'll need to study for his course."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,Awesome prof! Lectures are interesting and relevant. Exams are fair if you study!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,Great guy. His midterms are a bit too precise but overall i learned alot.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1330,"Houseman was the best prof I had first year. He made everything clear and interesting. Gives good hints and advice, follow it and you will be fine. The guy is class! No one better!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO1530,"Funny guy, Interesting lectures"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2121,I will
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2121,DigiZoo rocks; but I will never use zoology ever again!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2121,Your course was AWESOME; Digi Zoo rules!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2124,"One of the best. His midterms (and finals) are fair. There are many, many resources available. Too much in fact. So much that it's difficult to do everything. Although, his lectures are both interesting and clear. He keeps everything simple (K.I.S.S.). The only negative is that the man is mean in person (or in emails). I think he just needs a hug."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"One good and easy course!Has memorized everything and has a nice clear voice.Just write down what he says in class and memorize them.No need to waste money on books.His own book is useless,it's more of a gift. If you have questions,just send him an e-mail because in person, he gives u attitudes!Thinks he knows everything but he doesn't!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"memorize, memorize, meorize. What a phoney. Give him exactly what he wants to hear and you will score big time. Easy course and you do not have to think."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,He is surely very knowledgable. But he is utterly disrespectful towards students. Very mean and has a tendency to feel superior. The lab exam was off-limits. Don't take it if ou don't need it.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"At first,it seemed like a very interesting class. The prof.seemed amazing and I was keen to learn.Shortly after, his ""true"" side was revealed.He was a mean, old bully!He picked on students, yelled at them, and of course favouritism!My hopes went down after the 1st and even 2nd midterm. The lab exam was impossible, even if you spent weeks studing!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,It is true that he possesses immense knowledge in this field. But I must strongly emphasise the fact he can be a real bully and disrespectful towards other people. I have witnessed many instances in which he disregarded the emotions of students by personally attaching them and embarassing them in front of the class. I don't approve of this.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Articulate in class, interesting subject material, has fair midterms but is extremely insecure. He bullies students who come in early for another class to get approval from the audience. Digizoo is full of info, but also of typos, grammatical errors, and technical errors. The website doesn't even work unless it's in Internet Explorer."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"I am please to say that I've finally met the most brilliant man that I will ever meet in my entire life.  You could ask Houseman any question you want about anything zoology, and he knows the answer...beware of the biological drawings in the lab though! Very picky!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"AF&F was a really interesting class and I really recommend it. Houseman is a GREAT prof, one of the best I have had and everything is very interesting. He takes his own pics to show, and made his own helpful program Digizoo. This course is tough, work hard! The lab exam is impossible, you have to know everything. Be prepared for bad marks."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Very clear, and knowledgable.  There's way too much stuff to remember though, so you need to consistently do work, or else the course is just impossible.  Study off Digizoo, and the notes you take in class.  Text book is not so important."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,It's too funny that he uses the same material from the practice midterms for the current midterms. Make sure you STUDY Digizoo. Great prof too!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,Brutal. Get ready to take his exams up the but.  Too much information in too many sources... just a big head ache really
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,The best zoology prof! Very organised-all the sources are from him. He gives you digizoo and helps at every lab. Tough class but fun. Lot's of work so study right away!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Terribly arrogant. He's an OK lecturer, but has zero people skills. Even the TAs don't like him."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Best Prof ever!  He was the only prof who was able to make bio fun, after Heinermann Happened!  He takes time to teach well, and gives you all the resources you need!  He is always available to help you, just be sure that you're not asking a dumb question"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,He's very organized and genuinely cares about his students.  He has a great understanding of what he is talking about and explains it clearly.  I have lots of respect for this guy.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Really awesome, and really nice prof!  Gives you everything and more to be able to do well in the course.  Makes you think about the material and very fair on exams.  If you study the material, and go to class you'll do fine."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Really awesome prof, really well organized and very enthusiastic, enjoy yourself"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"VERY organized, his midterms are fair (although you're expected to know A LOT), can be pretty intimidating though"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,He's an excellent teacher but isn't very approachable.. think your questions over before you ask.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"**** prof, But one of the greatest"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,really good teacher who provides lots of help. wants his students to do well.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,"Best class I've taken so far, and I don't even like animals!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2125,Provides lots of learning tools
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,I was enjoying the course and doing well on the midterms and quizzes.... and then the lab exam happened :(
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Houseman is a great lecturer, even though he may talk super fast. Definitely go to class AND watch the podcasts. Find old tests online as he uses many of the same questions again. Study hard and memorize a lot! It's tough but there is no question he won't ask, even if he barely covered the topic. I liked him much better now than in first year!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Awesome prof, a tough grader and he expects you to really get to know the subject. He provides everything you need to know through lectures, digidiv and his labs. Also, try to memorize the crossword answers for easy points on midterms/exams!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"I've taken 2 courses with Dr. Houseman and he is one of the best lecturers iv had at university. he keeps his lectures very interesting, but he goes very fast and there is a lot of information in the hour and a half lecture. His exams are brutal, he's a very picky and stubborn marker. His courses require a lot of work!!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Dr. Houseman gets a bad rap, which is very undeserved. Definitely one of my favourite profs. Use his resources, be prepared, and definitely as him questions if you're not clear on something! He is very intelligent and a phenomenal teacher! "
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,I thought he was a great prof. I only took BIO2135 because of him
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Nicer in this class than BIO1130.  Podcasts will save your life, and test marking is very rigid, so don't expect any marks back from re-markings. Lab exam Labs are every week and lab final is ridiculous. Be sure to make Digidiv your best friend, it takes getting used to but all the information is nicely organized there."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Very interesting course! Houseman keeps the class interesting. There IS A LOT of material, so don't fall behind. Keywords and crosswords are essential for exams. Try your best to do well in the labs, as the lab exam will bring down your mark."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"<3 Love him. Amazing, thorough, funny. Brilliant prof!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"His exams aren't that hard. Just do the work. Also, remember his ""Voices from the past"" that he presents you? Ya, use it... he doesn't mention it for fun. He's pretty nice if you go and talk to him. He still says ""Hi"" to me when we meet on the street. Loved him, his class, his teaching... everything."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,<3 Pretty much in love with this man. Best prof ever.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,Best. Prof. Ever. I'm saddened that I won't have him as a professor anymore. He is the best at the University of Ottawa!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"This class is very challenging, but Dr. Houseman makes it fun. The labs are great too, except the lab exam is the worst exam you will write. Houseman is a fantastic professor that is very devoted to his job."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Houseman is a great professor. He is very devoted to his job, and it shows. He lectures very clearly, and his exams have been very fair. The labs are pretty fun too. However, there is a lot of work involved in this course. He is nicer in this course than in BIO1130, too."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Seemed like a very interesting, easy class until u got slapped with the first midterm. Very specific marking scheme (if you write platyhelminthes instead of free-living platyhelminthes you lose the entire mark no matter how much you wrote). Good prof, but expect a bad mark. Lab exam was impossible to do no matter how much u study."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO2135,I defy you to tell me that Dr. Jon Houseman does not care about his students. This guy wrote a book basically for this class and his studants use. Also i doubt I've ever seen someone as devoted to a class as him he goes through EVERY picture taken by EVERY student in our 500 person class every week. Amazing prof amazing class!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO33,"Dr. Houseman is a gr8 teacher in the classroom.Effective teaching methods.Very organized. Interesting topics presented.Liked the course but didn't like him as a person.His people skills are nothing close to his teaching skills.He is just mean.Take his courses.Honestly,u will enjoy the material but u also will see that teaching awards mean nothing!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO3323,"Took 2125, 3323, 3334, and 4161.  He's a great lecturer.  But he's gotten too tied up in getting all those teaching awards to give the same level of effort as he used to.  His assignments are not as clear as they once were."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO3323,Very interesting course. Labs are great. But the 2 papers are extremely difficult - the marking is very rigid you tend to get a lower mark. The final was extremely easy. I don't get why people think Houseman is a jerk - he's one of the only profs to reply to your email right away!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO3323,Provides lots of learning tools but hw has NO people skills... or maybe he has favorites...
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO3324,"Houseman can kick your ass so bad he can draw you a pic of how he's gonna kick your ass, send it to you 10 days in advance, show up at your door, ring the door bell, kick your ass, and you still wouldnt know what hit you. NICE GUY THOUGH"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO3324BIO2125,"This man is the best teacher at the University! His tests make it easy for you to get a good mark (provided you actually study) and his lectures keep you awake. He's always there to help you, even when you're not in his class! The labs that HE runs are really interesting and fun and Digizoo? A++"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO4161,"Houseman is awesome! He provides students with an amazing aray of resources (course web, crosswords). He likes to KISS (keep it simple stupid) which makes learning the material easier. You MUST attend class as his notes consist only of diagrams and figures. If you use the resources provided and study hard you'll do well. You rock Houseman!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIO4161,"Fun course! Just TONS of stuff to know and the midterm was very fair and straight-forward. The final exam was brutal (in terms of the essay portion) but the other parts were good. Just be prepared to memorize a whole load of stuff and show up to class every time! If you miss one, you'll fall behind!"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOA,"Presentation is fluid, interesting, funny and clear. This is a very organized course with a ton of tools to ensure success. Regarding the posts about his personality, I would rather have HIM than a nice guy who's course is hard to follow. I really like his courses and have always done well with hard work, I'll keep taking courses with him."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOA,"Best lecturer at this university. If you do the crosswords and the cengage now quizzes, you pretty much have a B right there."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOA,Oh my goodness Houseman...that Prof's midterms aren't hard but if you don't write the most concise definitions and descriptions on the evaluation you will be denied so many points. Old midterms and crosswords are a must...don't bother going to the exam without practicing them!
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOB,"Although a bit of a bum, he is one of the best biology profs you can ever get. He is extremely clear in what you should study for the final, and although their is a lot of content, you can tell what he wants you to focus on. Go to his lectures because he likes to give hints for his exams and will turn off the podcasts."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOB,Very interesting guy and he honestly seems to have the students interest at heart when it comes to learning the material but his exams are pretty hard. Mostly study what he just briefly goes over in class cause chances are that's what will be on the exam. and the keywords and crosswords are really helpful.
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOB,"A very hard marker to the point where I can't just believe it. Do not, I repeat DO NOT, sign up for this class unless it is a must. If that's the case good luck."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOB,"he is really good , great resources ... perfect teaching method"
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOC,"Expects you to know to know so much material but only tests you on a select few things..problem is, you don't know what those things will be so you just have to try and study everything which can be overwhelming. This is not a class you can cram for and memorizing old midterms will only help a little. Side note, only prof that teaches the course."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,BIOSECT,"What a mean prof. i hate him. Exams were so hard, so much to memorize. He is so proud of himself from winning worthless award.  Jerk."
University of Ottawa,Jon Houseman,ENG1109,I absolutely loved this guy.  He really tries to make sure everyone does well.  His website obviously took alot of effort.  I think it is fantastic when a prof. actually cares how his students do. AND he is very funny.  I think he is a great prof. you just have to study.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"Rude, arrogant, easily irritable. 
Toxic, disrespectful, makes your life miserable. 

Does not create a nurturing educational environment for us to grow as students. I feel bad for her children *IF* she has any. 
"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"clueless on whats going on in class, very disorganized. Tells you things that will be on the mid term and not actual on it. Do not recommend taking this class at all.... No idea how she is a professor."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"I definitely wouldnt take her classes again, her slides are confusing, and the class is extremely boring, although it is fairly easy. I hope you are ready to do a group project alone. Good luck!"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"Paula Sauveur is not a very good professor. Her slides are confusing and she's extremely dull in her lectures. It is without a doubt, however, that she is extremely intelligent. I guess teaching is not her thing. She's an easy marker and will tell you exactly what questions will be on the midterms and the final."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,she reads the slides and does not really teach.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"I took Social Context of Business With her. The group assignment was hard because my group members were terrible, but Paula accommodated this and didn't give them any marks. Go to class because she tells you the exact questions she's going to put on the exam as 80% of her slides are irrelevant. Her exams are a lot of writing no MCQ so study a lot."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"The most disorganized class, there is not point to her classes and not even to class review before the exams, she only make us memorize every single slices, her midterm was ALL open questions. Did not use the book at all, she has a lot of attitude and does not know how to teach."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"Horrible prof, nothing more to say."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"Horrible teaching!!! She reads from slides, is not engaging, has super disorganized slides and does not reply to emails. Don't go to class just read the textbook and review slides."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"She reads off the slides, you don't need to show up to pass. She roams the class to make it ""interactive"" if you don't wanna talk, don't take her."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,"I can tell Prof Paula Sauveur is a native French speakers by attending her course, But YOU WILL NEVER WITH TO GO TO HER ENGLISH CLASS. Her lecture slides are hard to understand in English, and She uses French based English in both the lectures and exams."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,WORST! Don't need to attend class. Everything is on the slides and textbook. Not organized. You have to learn by yourself. Asking questions will only get you more confused. Has attitude. Very boring.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1101,Doesn't know what she is doing
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1300,"I did not find her class to be worthwhile. In retrospect I could have dropped it. Difficult to understand, and not much value is added from her teaching, as she just reads the slides."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1300,lectures were very content heavy. Can't have a moment to think and process the information before moving onto a new concept. Exams were easy but lots of time needed to study the content. She also picks students to answer questions in class fyi.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1300,I read the reviews and figured she couldn't be as bad as they said. Dropped the class because she's so bad at her job. If she doesn't know how to say a word in English she says it in French. Not knowledgable when you ask her questions. Just read the textbook and you'll learn more than you ever will from her.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1300,Does not know the course material and reads directly off the slides. Also cannot understand questions when you ask them. She just does not know what she's doing.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM1300,"The way she presents her lectures are hard to understand. I am unsure if English is her first language but she does not seem to know how to word questions properly. Thank goodness this is only introduction to business where everyone taking this class knows most of the content anyways. If you did not take business in high school, then watch out."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM2337,"The slides were not organized at all and she goes very quickly. The grading scheme is unfair and difficult (if you don't mention one thing, no point) . She asks very specific questions on the midterm that she says in class, not from the slides or textbook. The professor is not approachable or understanding whatsoever. Wouldn't recommend."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,ADM2704,"It seems like she knows what she is doing, until you ask a question or try and do homework! She follows the book, you don't get extra notes besides what's written inside. She formulates the questions differently then other profs on test, so that's why you don't do well! She corrects blindly (giving extra points) so you don't get good feedback -.-"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,DCC,not recommending her...
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,DRC1714,You'll get the grade you deserve if you write specifically what she said in class. Pay attention when she says that something will be in the exam; it will be the case.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,DRC1714,"Worst teacher I've ever had. Lots of attitude and sarcasm, very unhelpful. Doesn't use her own notes so she doesn't know what she's talking about. The exam was average but you have to teach yourself the material because learning in class is hopeless, as you spend so much time typing what she has on the screen (which she doesn't send before class)"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,EVS1501,One of the worst prof I've ever had. Her class was all about memorizing definitions without putting them in context. I'm very glad I had a good basic knowledge in bio (being 4th year bio student) because she was very unclear in her explainations half of the time. Reads off slides and gets through a lot of material with no real point.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GN4170,"Paula is just as bad (or even worse) than the reviews say. She's rude, arrogant and a terrible lecturer. You have no idea how the exams will be structured and they're full of errors. Evaluations are also very subjective and harshly grade. It's extremely hard to get a great grade, but it's also hard to fail."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Awful. Sadly there's no way out of taking her class for most students in eng. she teaches the most useless class of your degree but makes it seem like the most important.  
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,I really appreciated how she opened home studies and options to FaceTime her for extra office hours. We had a few study sessions at her house. She wanted us to share her address and phone number for all students: 124 Rue de Roquebrune in Gatineau & 1-819-712-7219.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Lots of students like to complain about Aziz on the subreddit but Paula is on a whole other level. Refuses to answer emails, teach, or mark. I am shocked how she can do literally no work and not be terminated 5 years ago. Future engineering law students should boycott the class. Maybe low attendance will finally get the university to do something. "
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Taking this as a remote class, she only live-lectured maybe about 4-5 times, and most of the time when she did do a live lecture it involved guest lectures lol. She doesn't like being asked questions and has an attitude. Course content is not difficult, the professor is the one who complicates things. Also, don't buy her textbook. "
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Graded on a case study, a midterm, and a final (which is a quiz and a case study). If you have access to anything from past years she will copy paste, don't expect to see your midterm because she gatekeeps her content and treats her students like little thieves which is ironic since her textbook is highway robbery. Rude, unreasonable and lazy. "
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"I'm baffled that the school charges us money for this. We only saw her 5 times during the semester, the rest were pre-recorded lectures that were over a year old, and one of those 5 times she delivered the lecture on her phone while out shopping in a store. I wish I could make this up. Worst prof in at the school hands down"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,I'd say the only reason her rating is this high is because you're not allowed to give a rating of 0. Only graded on three things throughout the course. Tells you to buy her mandatory textbook that is identical to free laws found online. Disrespectful towards her TA's and very full of herself.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Everyone has said everything there is to say about her. It's shocking she can have a job with how toxic a professor she is.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Her course is not hard but is a considerably hostile environment in which she tries to strip students of as many marks as possible. Course material is very light though, don't buy the textbook: everything is online. Whatever you do, make sure she doesn't figure out your name; don't email or talk in class because she will make your life miserable."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,She is so bad she had to fake her OWN rmp rating last year. USELESS BOOK! DON'T BUY! 100% of her book can be found online. This monster MUST be fired. Our tuition & tax dollar cannot be used to fund her incompetent as*. She is the reason humanity's ethical standards deteriorate. CURRENT STUDENTS: Remember to downrate her on RMP and evaluation forms
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"This lady has a big ego problem. She'll tell you that you absolutely HAVE to buy her book multiple times, this is a lie. Many people don't buy her book and pass her class. I bought the book, it's terrible quality (spine broke first week), it's split 50/50 down each page English and french, many sections are only in french. Just google the PEO act."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"One of the worst, rudest prof that you can't skip in uOttawa. Not accessible outside the class. If she force you to buy her useless $200 book, just ignore her broke asss, you can find all legislation or law online for free. A friendly reminder, don't attend the live lecture, she talk quick and don't repeat, go watch recording, make your life easy."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Horrible professor. She is very high on herself, almost feels like she bullies the TA in a way. VERY rude in general, will not answer questions if the answer to them is even vaguely mentioned in her notes (which are lack lustre at best). Despite a large portion of the notes having blanks, she fills less than half of them and glosses over the rest."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Even though the course itself is not hard and the course expectations are clear, Prof. Sauveur is not a great prof. She's rude, a very tough grader even doesn't let you send an email directly to her and finally, I had to pay 250 CAD to get her book SHIPPED to my home country because there was no online/pdf version available. Avoid if possible!"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"If you're deciding which University to go to based on prof rating, I think this tells you all you need to know about uOttawa"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Paula Sauveur is the reason 0/5 should exist on Rate My Professors. She is the worst professor the University of Ottawa has ever hired. Don't believe me, just google her name and look at the Reddit post."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Just didn't teach and very disorganized. Made me never want to learn law again even though it could be an interesting subject...
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Paula gives little to no feedback for the exams and assignments. Refuses to be contacted directly by students. Mandatory textbook consists of information available online, basically a copy and paste."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Best prof at uOttawa. Inspiring, wants her students to succeed, clear expectations of her students, great feedback on assignments and exams. Also her book of laws is great and worth the 100$. "
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"WORST PROF EVER. Get ready to HATE her. She will SKIP CLASS, REFUSE to ANSWER EMAIL, WORST GRADER, and will FORCE YOU TO BUY a totally USELESS textbook. She REFUSES to provide MIDTERM ANSWERS, and will do everything in her power to give you the LOWEST POSSIBLE MARK."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Worst professor I've ever had, and likely the worst professor at uOttawa. Terrible grader, will refuse to talk to you over email, and has no issue with insulting you straight to your face. She strives to make student's lives miserable. She makes you buy her textbook which is useless since you can find everything online. She is a terrible professor."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"-no written assignment (only MC midterm) until 2 weeks AFTER deadline to drop -NO MIDTERM SOLn availablebut will reuse midterm for summer -cannot email her, only the TA -worst teacher ever -misses class for no apparent reasonhad us waiting for 30+ mins -forces participation in online class -HORRIBLE as a person/profwants you to fail AVOID"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"By far the worst professor at uOttawa. Lectures were not organized well and she is very rude towards her student. When I first read the reviews, I didn't think that she'd be this bad but after taking this class with her, I now know why people hate her so much. 0/10 would not recommend her for any course."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Where do I start. Please stay away from her courses. Firstly, we HAVE to buy a $100 textbook which she literally copied from the Government of Ontario's documents available in public domain. Doesn't answer emails. Oh and the final? Doesn't matter if you hand in the best work or literally a blank paper - you will get a straight 75. Worst prof at UO."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Has a mandatory textbook that she wrote. Goes WAY to fast and tells students to review recordings half the class cant access. 0/10 would not recommend.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"It's quite shocking how brutal Paula is at conveying the course material. She is extremely arrogant and her lectures are nonsensical. Only content provided was ppt with blanks where key terms should be, and rambling lectures to a backdrop of her scrolling through a word doc."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"In my opinion Paula Sauveur is not a good teacher at all, she doesn't seem to care about her students and speaks way too fast in class to be able to learn well. I don't recommend taking her course at all if it is a course you are not obligated to take. Avoid at all costs! P.S. online courses are not fun."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,gose too fast and wont right down the blanks she left in ppt
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"I've had profs who can't teach, but at least they wanted you to succeed, Paula on the other hand, can't teach and ACTIVELY TRIES to fail her students. Ethical questions aside about an ETHICS prof selling you THEIR textbook, or giving an entire class 75 for their final exam, Paula is an awful prof who fails to convey even the most basic of concepts."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,I've had my fair share of terrible professors but most of them just suck at teaching. Paula has a special way of making you hate her and also be absolutely garbage at teaching. She focuses more on her narcissistic accomplishments than actually teaching the class. Majority of her class content was blank. She gave everyone I know a B+ on the final.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Awful, unfortunately ratemyprof doesnt allow 0 as rating. So I was unwillingly forced to change my 0 rating to a 1.0 rating."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"In short, skip her. She has no business with teaching whatsoever. Youre literally better off learning the course yourself, because she actually confuses you by teaching. To add to that, shes a strict strict grader; I would understand that if she was any good at teaching, but she offers the worst combination. Bad teaching and strict grading."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Absolutely the worst prof I have ever had in university. Terrible at keeping her students up to date. Made students teach themselves the last lecture only a few days before the final. Made us by her textbook which she has literally copied word-for-word from common law that is widely available online. Avoid her at all costs.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,I can't believe they're still letting her teach this summer. People should write to the dean about her.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"I don't even know where to start. If you could avoid this prof, do it by all means. There is absolutely no clear grading criteria, it's a lotto. We haven't covered a single sample case study in class, yet her exams/assignments are based on case studies. You'll pass the course, but don't expect much. Good luck people!"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"I reluctantly enrolled in this course only because my schedule opened up for another course. After seeing past reviews, I thought it might be better to wait until the course is offered by another prof. Unfortunately, despite the unanimous negative feedback, it doesn't look like Paula is going anytime soon."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Dont bother speaking because youre wrong, and I hope youre bilingual because her PowerPoints are. She has so many rules; getting your mark reviewed is harder than filing taxes. Oh, and you're wrong."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"By far the must frustrating class I have taken. The notes/slide shows are a complete mess and seem random, she will put french paragraphs in notes (for the english section classes). People were so outraged by the midterm that people starting yelling during the review and she was yelling back for them to chill, it was chaos. Horrible but unavoidable"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"This professor is pure garbage. She doesn't care about students, misses all her lectures and keeps changing the rules for midterm. She doesn't know what's happening in her OWN class and doesn't know how to teach at all. Worst professor I ever had, extremely disrespectful and tough grader."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Very poor choice. She forces everyone to spend around $100 on the textbook she wrote but justifies it by saying she barely earns anything off it. She is very condescending towards students and talks down to those who ask questions. Puts students on the spot with questions in front of the whole class. And she teaches all the sections for this class!
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Her lectures are incoherent. She spells contract as ""Kontract"". Enough said"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,First professor I've ever seen to spend 2 hours on a syllabus.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,Very poor lecturer. She over explains everything and makes things more complicated than they need to be. Puts students on the spot with a microphone. Overall pretty painful classes to sit through
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"She is extremely condescending and disrespectful towards her students. When I tried to get marks on multiple choice questions that had more than one correct answer due to phrasing, she admitted her questions were ambiguously phrased and agreed with the logic of my alternative answer but refused to give me my marks. Avoid this professor if possible."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"She's easily the most disorganized prof I've ever had. She goes on off-topic tangents that make no sense and then goes back to reading the slides, which are messy and hard to follow. She'll also tell you one thing in class and say something completely different in over brightspace/email. If she's teaching, wait to take law."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,Honestly this is the worst teacher in history 
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"She is the worst professor in the northern hemisphere. Extremely arrogant and unprofessional. Doesn't know how to translate her french notes to her english ones, leaving multiple mistakes behind. Also a genuinely bad person whose ego is so big she would have to buy 2 plane tickets to go anywhere. Absolutely disgusting display of teaching. AVOID"
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,The worst of all
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,Just Google her name and you'll learn all you need to know about her.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,By far the worst professor I've seen in my 4 years at uOttawa.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"Refuses to teach, refuses to mark, refuses to answer student emails. She's easily the worst professor you'll ever have."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,Very tough grader !
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,I'd like to write a fair review of Professor Sauveur that outlines the pros and cons of her marking strategy. Cons: you'll get a 75 on her exam even if you get everything correct Pros: you'll get a 75 on her exam even if you hand in a blank page
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"Paula thought the following exchange was ""academic fraud"" and called out two of her students (by name) in front of all their peers. Student 1: ""Did anyone get their grade back for the ethics case?"" Student 2: ""Nope"""
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,I don't know why she cares about students talking to each other during the exam period if she's just going to give everyone a 75 anyways.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,How does uOttawa still employ a professor who doesn't teach? Hiring Paula to teach a class is like hiring a whale to mow your lawn.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,I didn't think she'd be as bad as the reviews said. I was wrong.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,Only taught two PowerPoints all semester (she posted an additional PowerPoint on Brightspace during COVID-19) because she cancelled most of the classes and spent most of the lectures she did teach talking about material unrelated to the course.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,Really bad at communication with students.
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"Where do I begin, really? Very disorganized. Her lectures are all over the place. I promise you you wont even know what shes talking about for that entire lecture. Upon receiving grades for our final exam, I realized about 75% of the entire failed, so she was forced to put some kind of curve to salvage her reputation as a horrible prof."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"I mean, if you look at her rating, it pretty much tells the whole story. I dont know what else I can add to that. If I could give her a 0/5, believe me I would. Shes a 0 not just as a professor, but as a person. However, to be fair , shed be a strong 2/5 as a monkey, so its not entirely all bad. Tough grader, horrible teacher."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,Maybe if everyone boycotts the engineering law course the university will finally do something about her?
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"Some of these tags need opposites to describe Paula: ""Gives good feedback"", ""Respected"", ""Accessible outside class"", ""Inspirational"", ""Clear grading criteria"", ""Amazing lectures"", ""Caring""."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"She is probably the worst prof i've had in my college life. Avoid her at any cost. I mean the rating (1.2) speaks for itself, i don't know why she is even a university professor. Just awful."
University of Ottawa,Paula Sauveur,GNG4570,"I took it in winter 2014 She is NEVER prepared, she just writes things that come to mind, and is a weird person, and a tough grader."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,"He is very knowledgable but can be grumpy and disrespectful to students who ask questions. This online course was well structured and organized. However, the midterms and final were unnecessarily difficult and not created to maximize student success. Had to email him several times to be able to review my graded exams. Avoid this prof if you can.
"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,"All his lectures are prerecorded, despite the class being listed as in-person, so it's basically an online class. The only time I saw him outside of a prerecorded video was during the first class, which was over Zoom, and he was rude and sounded annoyed when answering students' questions about the course. The weekly online assignments were decent."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,before we get started i wanted to remind you that the property of Gordon Lenjosek and the material presented in this recording is only for eco 1104 students
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,"Other than the online assignments, course was pretty hard. The videos are prerecorded from years ago and give you a good understanding of the material, but they are so long and even after studying it does not help for the exams."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,"Please if you have an econ course, pick ANY other prof. He used prerecorded lectures that would be up to 3.5 hours, the TAs taught the actual classes. He has no enthusiasm, does not answer questions, makes you feel stupid, and the tests were nothing like the practice ones. AVOID!!!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,Full of himself. When asking questions replies with sarcastic remarks if material is already covered in another section or the syllabus. All lectures are far too long and are pre-recorded from past years.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,1104,"very good prof. I like his sense of humor, and his lectures are very efficient. I'd like to take his class next semester. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,2144,"He's awesome. He's here to teach, and he does exactly that. He delivers the material well and sets very clear expectations as to what you need to get a decent grade. Work hard and go in there knowing that it won't be easy, but it's not because Lenjosek makes it that way, it's really just the material being inherently difficult at first. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Following rating is the least obvious fed.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Everyone is soft, he is providing clear expectations to prepare you for the real world"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Prof sucks don't take his classes. He doesn't help his students and doesn't convey material in a logical and simplified form. He wrote the textbook and made sure we all knew that. I reached out for help multiple times and was told there was nothing he could do to help me. Prof doesn't care about his students learning 
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"ECO 1104 (onl) & ECO 1102 (bi-m). His lectures aren't super engaging online, but he does try to interact with students & seems to enjoy it more in-person. Once you get a feel for his expectations, he is fair but it won't be easy. I recommend doing the readings before class so you can follow his lectures without writing everything down - talks fast"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"avoid this man at all cost if you can. never takes time to explain anything. repeats his power point slides, goes through them hella fast so you don't eve have time to write anything down. he's mean, it's like he prides himself in making life very difficult for students. take someone else if you can fr this is life changing advice"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Straight up, hes rude. He doesnt care about his students. His lectures are over 3 hours and are so boring which makes it so difficult to learn because you loose focus. However, he is not a bad teacher and if you push through the negatives you will learn the content. Microeconomics is very difficult though."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"I would not recommend taking Prof Lenjosek. His lectures are very boring and unclear. Doesn't teach the material well, and has a very monotone voice."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,He should work on his empathy
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"probably my heaviest class but one of my better marks. watch the lectures but use the textbook to copy notes so you can screenshot images/graphs. if you do all the connect assignments (free marks, most of it's on quizlet) and read the textbook carefully it should be an easy class to get a B+ or better in. he can be dry but his exams are pretty fair"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Horrible prof, don't ever take him or you will regret it."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Frankly I'm not sure why the reviews are so mixed. ECO1104 and ECO112 are both relatively straightforward courses. Exams were fair. Assignments were essentially free marks.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Very good prof. Makes his expectations very clear, and all assignments/exams are fair and manageable if you keep up with the course material. I would take his class again no doubt."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Decent prof! His midterms and final were very fair. You don't need to attend lectures (although they are helpful) just read the textbook extensively and do practice questions. He's also nice albeit dry. He gets bad reviews but he was actually pretty good and very fair
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Weekly assignments are given and not very difficult as you are able to complete them twice for a higher grade, but aren't related to the midterms. Midterms are basically designed to make you fail. The workload wasn't crazy but the mid-terms were awful. Surprised if anyone got a good mark on them. Avoid this prof if you can."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Just avoid this prof, not willing to help, doesn't post notes when the class is online, midterm questions are made to be super tricky and are somewhat unrelated to the course content... Overall just makes the class harder than it should be, take another prof."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"the worst and rudest professor at uOttawa. Tests are difficult, lectures are boring and his attitude is horrendous. Seems like his life is unhappy and he takes it out on his students. Avoid at all costs."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"He makes us do Chapter assignments every week but then the midterm is completely unrelated to it, the lectured are 2 hours plus and v boring. We all failed the midterm as well so please avoid this course to the best of your ability."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Professor Lenjosek is a good prof. His lectures really helped me understand the course material as he goes into the detail (especially with graphs).
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"it is a hard course to take with this professor, he doesn't seem kind to the student, and his speech is quick and not very clear and you have to pay for the website connection to complete your assignment. overall, it's not good at all."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,A mediocre proffesor but his exams are fair.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Getting past his humour, I thought his teaching was stimulating. I have another class with him and am genuinely looking forward to it. His exams are verbatim what he teaches in his lectures and what you attain from reading the textbook. If you study, you'll do great."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Boring. Very boring to listen to, and the content is easy enough to self-teach. Just do the reading from the textbook, and check the slides. Midterms were easy though, all multiple choice. He can also come across as rude sometimes, but you can avoid that if you're not at the lectures."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"very dry lectures, just use the book and his slides you should be fine. He comes off as rude sometimes and when asked a question he sometimes doesnt answer. would take another prof"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Dry humour, available outside of class for help, quizzes are a good grade booster"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"I did not enjoy this class, mostly due to Professor Lenjosek's teaching style. He is quite rude to his students and often rushes through vital parts of the lecture slides without allowing enough time for you to copy it down. His exams are relatively difficult, be sure to read the textbook and go to the lectures as he doesn't post the powerpoints."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,He refuses to post his lecture notes and goes through the slides so quickly. Take pics of the slides if you can. The connect and the textbook make a lot of sense but the exam isnt like that. The exam takes a lot of application so you need to really understand. Its a very tough course
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Lenjosek is not the nicest guy in the world nor tries to be. If you don't need the class I would suggest not taking it. Going to class is not that beneficial and you don't need to go to get a good grade. All midterms and exam are purely based on the textbook. Connect might seem like a rip off but it does make reading the textbook easier.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,reading only the textbook will NOT help on midterms or finals. you must look at his powerpoints or other information because you will super confused on tests just by looking at the textbook.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,DO NOT TAKE IT. I REPEAT. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS> His assignments have either a lot of errors or are not precise. You will often get confused. His class is boring and you get everything from the book or online.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"I genuinely like this prof., he's really nice and approachable. If you aren't a math person get ready to WORK girl. Even in office hours, he has difficulty explaining it in a way that makes sense to non-mathers. Don't bother going to class, everything is on bright space and in the textbook. Weekly online assignments."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Everything covered in the lectures was already in the textbook, so it started to feel redundant after the first two weeks or so. Do the readings, do the assignments, and you'll be fine."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"I liked Lenjosek, have had him for a couple of classes, pretty dry sense of humour, but that makes the class worth going to. Good lectures, but not an easy grade, you have to work for it and practise. That said, I would take him again in a heartbeat if offered."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"His lectures are so dry and his personality is so cold. He's always complaining and he usually talks fast and doesn't provide the slides after. The practice midterms are so useless - in summary: just dont take him. And if you do, make sure that he's your last option and there's no one better."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"A pretty average economics prof. His lectures are lifeless, and he is not super accessible outside class. The textbook is important, and he bases the course off of it. His midterms and final were all pretty fair, but the material is too boring to care about."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Just an average prof. He do not reply often to question (google is your friend) and have no passion in teaching (probably he like more doing research) Although, he's exam is pretty fair and not complete is you study for it."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Lectures are dry but useful if you want a good grade in the class. He is intimidating so asking questions can be difficult but exams are fair and assignments are an easy way to get a higher grade.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"always in a bad mood, doesn't seem to like teaching"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Good professor, knew the content and what was behind it, and delivered it effectively. But abrasive, but only if you go against his clearly defined rules. Would certainly take his courses again."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"If you just show up and listen rather than watching a movie on your laptop, youll be fine. Sometimes the stuff he talks about can be dry but he's accessible outside of class if you need to talk to him. He helped me out a lot and he does care about your success. People are probably bias because they want this class to be easy A. He's pretty funny."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"You learn a lot from this prof. His notes are thorough and lectures very intense and informative. Go to all lectures, listen to his advice, do applia. Easy to talk to during office hours and always responds to email questions."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"He gave me the impression that he did not want to be there when he was speaking. I was scared to ask questions, as he would probably not answer them or make a remark about how ""we should know this already"". Both midterms were fair. Aplia assignments were fine and were free marks. Classes were boring but the slides posted were easy enough to follow."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"I had him for 1102, he's very well spoken and will respond to emails. However, he's quite arrogant and his tests are definitely more difficult than other professors teaching 1102. Aplia is an easy mark booster but it won't make up for if you bomb a midterm or the final.."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"His lectures were extremely dull. He tended to overcomplicate simple concepts, and make mistakes in his own examples, confusing students even more. Tests are difficult. Would not recommend this prof."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,He is very good at explaining concepts and his slides are well done but he is the hardest of 1st year micro and macro profs at OttawaU and it is very difficult to get an A or higher.  He also is very strict but was helpful during office hours explaining concepts.  If you want to learn lots I would take him but if you want a good mark you shouldn't
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Gordon Lenjosek is a unique prof in the sense his classes are a hit or miss.  One class might be good, the next your board and waiting for it to end.  Gives a practice midterm/exam to do before the real deal which is very helpful as they closely reflect each other.  Not very enthusiastic but lectures are effective.  Overall, decent but not bad"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"While I did generally enjoy the material studied, I did not enjoy having Gordon Lenjosek as a prof. The material isn't very difficult, but he essentially makes slides right from the textbook and then reads the slides word for word. If you're a good studier and can learn quickly you don't even need to attend to do well. Aplia is used which I liked."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Great class, awesome and caring prof. Fantastic notes, textbook not needed.  Definitely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. Gives bonus marks through weekly on line quizzes  that help you not fall behind with lecture material. Fair midterms & exam, no surprises, gives extra exam prep class. Always willing to answer my questions."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,The concepts aren't easy but if you attend lectures and follow his notes you can do well. He is very fair and let's you know what is important to study. His slide notes are the best and don't really need the book.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Very fair and though you need to work and understand the content to get a good mark, expectations are clearly laid out right at the start of the course. His notes were the best and attending and listening to all lectures is key. Very approachable during office hours and gave good advice and answers to all my questions. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Do not recommend at all. Laughed at people in the class when they asked questions regarding the exam, or any questions for that matter. Doesn't seem to have any respect for his students. Makes people feel embarrassed and stupid for asking questions, and won't even answer them. Expectations were not realistic for first year intro to macro students"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Lenjosek's most redeeming quality is his clarity and his lecture notes. You know what to do and what to expect. Other than that, the general consensus seems to think he is arrogant with a personality that is hard to relate to and his sense of humour suggests he got bullied growing up. Read the textbook, study the slides, and watch youtube videos!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"you have to be the perfect and most organized, hard working student who reads ahead and takes notes every class and studies days beforehand , in which the day before an exammidterm, you should be revising notes, drawing graphs perfectly like no other tomorrow, otherwise say goodbye to good grades"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"If there was a definition for a heartless man, he'd be it. His lectures are long and even if he sees every single student tired, he wouldn't care. Exams are difficult as well. He's a good lecturer nevertheless and has very clear expectations of his students. Do the work you'll get the grade you need. Wouldn't fully recommend though."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Likes to make obscure acronyms for words. Instead of calling 'exports' like 'EX' or something he calls it DPGSB (domestically produced goods sold abroad) makes things more confusing. Also writes formulas that don't make sense. ex: equity  assets - liabilities BUT assets  liabilities. Laughs at students who ask questions, seems angry if questioned"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"love his lecture notes when I overselpt the morning classes. But as someone else said, notes became confusing when it was getting to the end of the class. However, exams( especially final) are super tough. It's not an easy A for sure. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Not a very exciting or helpful professor. 
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"I don't know why he is rated so highly. His classes are very boring, and his midterms are killer. They are fair, but hard, you basically need to know everything. Tricky in that sense. His slides are good, but they get confusing towards the end. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Very helpful prof and has thorough power points and notes. However, his mid-terms and finals are extremely difficult(Like they will kill ur GPA). He has unrealistic expectations for them. He means well though."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Very hard class, take it with someone better."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Easy professor, no need to buy the book. Very willing to help and give tips. You don't really need to attend his classes because he posts his slides online unless you need further clarification. The midterm and exam were fair."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Pretty solid prof. He knows his stuff and you'll learn a lot in his class. Though the exams were pretty difficult they weren't unfair.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,"He was never available outside of class and whenever you would go to him or email him, he would give you a short aggressive answer. He always seemed like he was better and way smarter than his students in all aspects and when asked to regrade or to look into problems, he would disregard it."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,"Selfish and not helpful. He leave the lecture meeting immediately after the lecture is done and is not willing to assist his students even during his office hour. Not a nice guy at all, rude and very inpatient and does not care about his students (would ask us to think from his perspective tho) This guy does not worth knowing."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,Wasn't helpful when I reached out for help. Don't give any extra assignments to help raise your grade and overall doesn't seem to care about his students. Is very opinionated and brings up unrelated things during lectures. I only took this class because I had to but I would try to get a different prof if you can.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,"Not an east class, if you want good grades, read the textbook, do the assignments, read through ALL of his slides, pay attention to even the smallest details given in class. The prof is accessible outside of class and is quite intimidating. His tests overall are fair if you manage to remember and undertand THOROUGHLY everything."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,not good.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,Prof Lenjosek is very fair and his lectures are always helpful and clear. His slide notes are great and you don't need to use the textbook. The Aplia is a perfect way to gain added marks. Midterms and exams are fair and represent what is taught. He is always available to  answer questions and respond to emails quickly. Great classes.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,"I took both macro and micro from professor Lenjosek and fr they were the hardest thing I've ever learn. I'm not saying they were just hard, of course i've learned stuff that was much harder than economics but he made it way harder and boring. no offense but i think economics is quite boring by itself and honestly he made it to another level."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,He gets confused often when teaching the class and doesn't seem to know his slides very well. The midterms are way more difficult than the practice midterms and quizzes. Definitely would not take his class again.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,Great prof overall! Very kind and helpful
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Bad attitude and seems full of himself. Overall unenjoyable class to take and could have substituted the class with self-learning.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Worst ever, very rude, sexist, racist, thinks he knows everything and will make fun f people who ask questions during q&a his lectures from before COVID are over the time the class is and he goes on about nothing."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He's a horrible teacher. He's condescending, he'll never answer your questions properly and he's plain rude. His final made no sense and he had grammar mistakes on it. Midterm was okay if you really study but his final is a joke. Do not recommend him. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,The second midterm and the final were extremely hard. Very tough grader and literally does not teach. Posts pre-recorded lectures and PPTs. AVOID if you can!
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Him and Professor Perez combined which I found difficult as nothing was consistent and for an in person class it only had tutorials done by their TA and recorded lectures. His lectures were very long and monotone so I often put it in double speed. Overall things needed to be more in depth and this was by far my worst mark this term. 
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"His class was supposed to be an in-person class, however everything was pre-recorded and put on brightspace. 20% of your grade depends on spending money on an online program but honestly it wasn't too bad. Problem is, I learned more from the TA's than the prof himself, and his lectures go on for forever. All things considered, not too bad. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,This was suppose to be an in person class however he decided to recycle his covid recorded lectures and make us watch them instead. By far my lowest grade in my opinion resulting cause he doesn't teach. If you like doing courses without instruction and exam questions nothing like the recorded lectures thankfully I don't have him for macro!
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"awful professor that can teach and be nice if he wants to, but choose not to"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He was very knowledgable, organized and used real life examples to further cement concepts. The class lectures were prerecorded and put online and was split with another prof (Blanco-Perez). I never went to office hours so I cannot attest to his ""rude"" character. Practice exams + assignments were WAY easier than the actual midterms and finals. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Avoid him at all costs unless you want to make your life harder. He's condescending and rude. His midterm and final exams are way harder than the weekly assignments and practice exams.  Someone said the course/exams were easy, and the ratings cannot be trusted. WHAT?! So we're all lying, and all of us just did terribly? That's BS!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Don't trust the ratings on this guy. The people complaining just did bad. I got an 80%+ on this class with never going to the lectures. The E-book provided is VERY good. 20% of the mark is online quizzes and has no time limit. Midterm/Exam is all multiple choice and some questions are VERY easy. Just focus on the E-book and you'll do well.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,The literal worst. Assignments and practice exams are nothing like exams and midterms. Makes exams ridiculously hard. Absolutely awful professor that must be avoided at all costs.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Such a difficult professor. I observed him laughing at students, shaming students for asking questions, and refusing to answer questions asked during a specific Q&A period. 

I suggest you take your economics classes with any professor, other than Gordon. He will not teach you, instead, he will fly through calculations/disregard student concerns "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Doesn't provide lecture slides, recycle recordings from 2021, and in-person classes are taught by the TA. DOES NOT answer any course-related questions. Tests are extremely hard and NOTHING like the practice midterms and assignments. On top of all this, the professor is rude and condescending. Either take class in French or don't come to uOttawa."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Midterms and exams are super hard and he overcomplicates everything. He's pretty nice and funny overall though. Homework is way easier than actual tests so you can never really properly prepare. Also even though this he was supposed to be teaching an in-person class, everything was online and only the tutorials were held in person"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Avoid at all costs. Actually don't have one nice thing to say about this guy. He's miserable. Had previously enrolled in his Macro class next semester & have now dropped it. No chance I'd take another class of his. I have never seen such a blatantly disrespectful professor. Don't expect this guy to care about you at all. His email replies, wow. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"When I first saw the comments on this website about him,I freaked out and wanted to swap it to another section, but honestly it's not that bad. It's not interesting but I suppose that's just how this class is, don't expect him to be too passionate about it, I think he has probably been teaching the similar material for thirty years."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"His lectures were really long and boring. Then his midterms and exams were really difficult and nothing like the assignment or textbook questions. He makes the class way more difficult than it actually is. If you want to get a good mark on this course, definitely take another prof."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Learn to pray, because you are...... Does not matter if you believe in god or nicki minaj. Just start praying whoever."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I would rather listen to heavy metal for 40 hours straight, than take him again. (Even North West is less mean than him)"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"the lectures were very well organized but long..... and boring..... all in all, he was not the nicest prof i've had so far."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"This course was absolutely awful. I had to stop watching the lectures because I genuinely didn't have time as he exceeded the amount of time provided each week. The lectures were asynchronous. He was mean, not welcoming, and most of all the exams had NOTHING to do with what we learned and he did not help us prepare. Get Chegg if you want to pass."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"In terms of course the course itself, it's not that bad. You'll definitely need to study, but it's doable. In terms of the prof, the other reviews aren't lying, he's not a nice guy. Avoid this prof if you can."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Hes ok. His lectures are pretty boring : not gonna lie. He talks very slow and monotone. But he's smart, you can tell he knows economics well. The tests are very hard, you need to study and practice!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I took his class as an elective - don't do like I did. His lectures were pre-recorded and definitely longer than if they had been during a scheduled class. He uses so many words to say so little, leaving students confused. It's definitely possible to pass if you go to the tutorials and use the textbook, but try to avoid him if you can."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"First, you have to buy a 80-100$ platform for the class. His lectures are dreadful and LONG on top of the tutorials, textbook, weekly tests... The tests are loaded and you're always on a time crunch. They're hard even after studying every practice question. His practice exams never reflected the material and his office hours were near unreachable."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I would avoid him if possible. He doesn't respect his students and has a bad attitude towards them. In his lectures, he over-explains stuff to the point where its super confusing. If you can't avoid him, stick to the textbook as everything he teaches directly reflects it."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Lectures covered everything but they we're very long and unorganized. Midterms and EXAMs we're harder than usual but still doable. Does not care about his students, very rude at office hours and threatens to fail students frequently."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Expected this course to be in person but it ended up being asynchronous minus the discussion groups. You can't email him and have to contact the TA for any questions. Tests were 99% multiple choice and there were weekly assignments which I personally enjoyed. Not the worst prof but wouldn't take again.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I had this prof for next semester too, and I made sure to change my class to have a different prof. He gave his lectures asynchronously and went over his allocated time EVERY WEEK.. In the first class, he legit said ""idont time for all of you, don't email me for questions"""
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"His lectures are extremely long and boring and he doesn't post the slides. All he does is basically read the entire PowerPoint really fast and you barely have time to understand anything. There's so many assignments, this was my heaviest course. He's very rude and doesn't seem to care if you fail. The final was too long, I will never take him again"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Taking this course as an elective course, one of the terrible decisions I have ever made."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Professor Lenjoseks pre-recorded lectures were very bland and monotone. I listened at 2x speed because the lectures were so long. The connect assignments were easy marks, but mostly unrelated to the exam material. The midterms were easy, but the final had so many questions and not enough time. Id personally look for another prof."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,The conetent he tested is beyond the scope of teaching!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He's not a professor, he's a Youtuber... Posts pre-recorded videos, literally tells you to not email him. The textbook explains well. The issue is his final exam was way harder than his midterms. He said 3 short-answer questions, but each of those 3 had 4 sub questions; that wasn't what he did for his midterms, unexpectedly messed up my grade..."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"The online course is super organized. The lectures are awfully long, however, if you just read the textbook you should be find. Don't know how he is in person, or over email (since I never had to email him about anything). Anyhow, if you're a student who is super independent you should be ok."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Not the nicest prof. Had to watch the lectures in 2x to help get rid of his condescending voice. Textbook is mandatory and is more useful than the lectures posted. Weekly assignments on connect based on the textbook. Exams were pretty hard. Avoid him unless he's the only option.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Worst teacher ever!! Disrespectful, and his teaching is bad! Exams are hard and long. Do not take him as your professor, youll regret it as i did!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,The way he teaches can make you feel bored of economics. The course is not hard.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Not the best teacher but not the worst. The lectures are informative and convey the material pretty well. The text book is way better at teaching however and Gordon seems to be always teaching in a condescending tone. Not my first choice of teachers but he'll do.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I did well because i spent a lot of time studying (10+ hrs/week). I did NOT enjoy his teaching. He also lacks professionalism. On our midterm, I wasted 10-15 minutes trying to figure out a question, later realizing that he forgot to add a graph to the question. He doesn't seem like a prof who cares about the students. If you can avoid."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"His midterms were long for a midterm of 1 hour and 30 minutes and it was hell. When everyone complained, he didn't bell curve it and told us it was easy. The midterm questions were also like pick the one that's most correct ( WE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON WHAT IS RIGHT) That class was also boring and the worst elective to take. AVOID at all cost!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Doesnt care about students, makes it quite clear the first day of class. Gets mad when you ask questions. Goes through lecture slides too quickly. Just read the textbook he doesnt teach anything different in his lectures. Words questions on exams to be confusing probably because its online. Has 0 trust in students thinks were all cheating"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"This prof is by far the worst. He does not give you enough time for his exams and his stechdule is just poorly organized. No fun allowed in class. Thinking about making a friendly comment? Well, think again. He has no respect when he emails his students, he responds with ""If you had a better grade..., Did you even..."" Avoid this prof at all costs"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"wow, by far the worst prof i had at UOttawa. In fact, i don't think i ever thought any of my profs were bad. But this one... he really doesn't seem to care if we understand the material or not. do urself a favour and take a different prof, if not take it another semester, just not with this prof."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,The WORST prof Ive had so far. Hes not helpful and it seems as though he considers his students as a burden. His tone is extremely rude and never available for extra help. Absolutely not empathetic especially during a pandemic. Avoid!!!
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Took a course shared between him and Prof Gray. Prof Lenjosek's lectures can be dry, but you'll get used to it. Never interacted with him outside of class. No posted PowerPoint slides because someone was selling them for money. If you're fine without the slides, he's a decent Econ prof with fair exam questions and good knowledge."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Weekly assignment questions come from ""Problems and Applications"" section at the end of each chapters. Lectures are prerecorded so you want watch it whenever you want. Lectures are very well explained."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Try to avoid this professor in the future. The quality of the lectures is not high, and there is little after-class help communication. The practice questions and the weekly QUIZ are almost inconsistent with the content of the midterm exam. The content of the study differs greatly from the content of the exam. So all of this leads to a lot of stude"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He is very knowledgeable on the subject and explains the material very well, providing many examples. An assignment is due every week that helps you understand the chapter better and gives you the ability to practice. Exams are average, really depends how comfortable you are with the subject. People skills could be better but overall good prof."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"With Gray & Lenjosek. Was incredibly stale. Every lecture was prerecorded. Nothing stands out with Lenjosek whatsoever. Weekly connect assignments are easy, I got a 97% without studying. The exam can replace the two midterms to be worth up to 80% of the final mark. The textbook is a must."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"As a person, he seems to be agressive. However, as a prof (most of the time) he is good. His slides are nice and they really help to understand the topics. He does not post them. He will answer emails and explain you things if you need it. He is very knowledgeable in the subject. The amount of work during the class was average."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"The midterm, the second one specifically, were unfairly hard to the point that over 200 kids have failed it and he refused to curve it and kept the average at a D+. He lacks the consideration and empathy for students who are learning online and doing/trying their best in this situation."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,He doesnt really seem to care about the students. He was also kind of rude right of the bat leaving a lot of students upset.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Initially had my worries about Lenjosek based off of the reviews on here. In short, he's a pretty decent guy, he cracks some jokes here and there and tries his best to make a dry subject entertaining. With the transition to distant learning, he has gone above and beyond to help the class. Go to lectures, take decent notes, read chapter summaries."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I like his teaching style, but the final exam was a nightmare. There were short answers while the other sections had all MC & it mainly covered chapter 18 & 19 which were the most difficult & not explained as thoroughly as the others. Had to do a welfare analysis of a positive externality (WTF is that) & covered ch. 18 while other sections didn't"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Comes off as mean and strict, but he's actually quite funny and cares about us doing well (i.e. dropped the bottom three worst grades from the online assignments). He has a dark sense of humour, but it's amusing. His lectures are very structured and full of examples which is very helpful."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Easy class, Economics is very boring but Gordon makes a good go of teaching it"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,He can be snarky at times and asking questions makes you feel like you're a bother. Midterms are alright but the exam is tough. Be prepared to be there the entire class time. One thing I can say is that the content itself is quite interesting.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Average prof. His lectures are dry and can get really boring. He can be a bit rude sometimes but honestly, he just does what he's supposed to do. Literally didn't pay attention in class at all but I did read the chapters in the textbook and took my own notes. DO read the textbook if you want a good mark, some questions are from the textbook."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He's a good teacher, can be snarky and rude at times but is otherwise good at teaching the material. His power points reflect the textbook pretty well but the textbook is still needed. There are weekly assignments in the class which are fairly easy if you pay attention. Overall it is an easy class if you pay attention."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"This professor does not care if his students pass or fail his class. Comes across extremely arrogant and is not accessible outside class hours. Luckily his slides are very descriptive and if you pair that with the textbook, you don't even have to go into class."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,A close minded professor
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Good prof who gives fair exams. Great notes and explains well in class. Bonus and easy marks can be gotten by doing Aplia. Just listen in class and read his notes to know all you need to study.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"The course content is really good in terms of helping you succeed. For instance, if you do the reading in this teacher's class and do the aplia assignments, as well as show up in class, you'll be okay. But he is exceptionally boring, so bring some entertainment with you :P"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Horrible teacher and overall rude person. He always shows up to class in a bad mood and it is not like he makes up for it by teaching properly, he is truly a bad teacher. To be honest, you do not need to show up to his class since his explanations will only confuse you. Course itself can be easy, read the textbook and you will be fine."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"THIS CLASS WAS ONE OF THE EASIEST COURSES I'VE EVER TAKEN WITH MINIMAL WORK. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ THROUGH HIS SLIDES, PAY ATTENTION ONCE IN A WHILE OR EVEN NOT SHOW UP TO CLASS. DO THE ASSIGNMENTS FOR FREE MARKS. HE IS NOT A VERY NICE PERSON OR GOOD AT TEACHING BUT THE COURSE CONTENT IS SUPER EASY."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He is very funny if you can take what he says with a grain of salt. His humour is very dry. He is very clear with his expectations but does get frustrated when students ask what he finds to be ""simple or stupid"" questions. DO THE WEEKLY ASSIGNMENTS."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Gordon is a great prof. He's a really tough marker so people always make it seem as if he's a terrible prof but he's really not. He's very clear in his expectations and tries his best to explain difficult topics. His lecture slides are perfect. He's also really funny. A great choice for economics.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Love this Prof!!!!! he is a tough prof but you really learn in his classes. I find him really funny!!! if you have any question, go to his office he takes the times to go over examples and make sure you understand"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"His slides are well written, very clear on what he is teaching, but he is probably the rudest prof i ever encountered. He is not good with speaking or responding to you with any problems or concerns you may have, he just lashes out and throws a fit. Heavy workload, and a tough grader. Would not recommend"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Solid choice, well-structured course. Multiple choices could be tough, but exams were fair. Slides were very similar to the textbook."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Gord is the man. If you serious about school and economics you can learn a lot from him. He knows the subject well and is a great teacher. He jokes around and treats the students like people and tries to engage learners.   His test are long and kind of intense in first year but study and you'll be fine.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"he gives tough love. Dont ask silly questions because he gets annoyed about it when students do that. In his class, you really do need to work hard to get a considerably good grade, like, you actually need to put a lot of effort into his class compared to other classes. Economic is quite dry ,he does try to make his slides more interesting, still.."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"he is an average professor, decent at best. The material is not difficult and you dont have to attend class really, you can just learn it on your own from the textbook. Midterms are fair, although very few MC's are almost impossible to know the answer for. I would take him again he is very average but definitely a rude professor."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Basically rereads you the textbook during lectures, which makes the class dull especially in the later chapters. This class requires a lot of work if you are not a math person. However, Aplia is a great grade booster. If I had to take him again I wouldn't mind but he would't be my first choice."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Lectures: Straightforward and clear (enough that you don't really need the textbook). Makes sure you understand the content and allows questions. Though it can be dull, he puts in a few moments of humor Aplia: Weekly assignments. Not extremely hard and he is quite fair  Tip: If you want to save money, just buy the Aplia code. Only thing you need"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,He's funny at times and you can get 20% from aplia which is incredibly easy with the textbook next to you. He won't even count your 2 lowest scores on aplia if u do all of them (1/week). His lectures do feel long sometimes because of him or the course and he takes nearly everything directly from the tb which makes studying easy but lectures boring.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Not the best prof Ive had, went to seek help from him on many occasions and each time he speeds past what hes explaining and makes the concepts more confusing.  I would say he has unrealistic expectations for the class for the difficulty of the midterms and final exam. Worked real hard in this class and it was the lowest mark of all my classes."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Amazing notes and extremely fair .
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Great professor with a sense of humour. Exams were challenging but fair. Definitely recommend.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Great prof! He tries to make everything clear and understandable for the students. I am not in Economics, but I took it as an elective and I don't regret it. Great class to get a great mark! Textbook is not needed, as his slides summarize them. He recycles questions on midterm and exam from previous exams which he posts. 20% just for Aplia!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Amazing slides, so much so you don't need to buy the textbook or even show up to class.. APLIA is a very easy booster and the exam and midterms were also very easy and straightforward."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,Reading from the textbook is not necessary for his class as long as you go and LISTEN to his lectures. He is a great lecturer- covers all topics in an interesting manner. He also gives some of the best class notes ive seen. Approachable guy. You can ask him questions and he wont talk down to you. He also asks for your opinions in class. Good prof
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104D,"They are so many economic teachers in Uottawa that avoid this one as much as possible. He's questions are hard, expect you are willing to put in the work. All multiple choice midterms, you have to pay for assignment. Good luck"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104D,Prof is okay. A lot of material but he is clear on what we need to know. The first two midterms were both all multiple choice which was nice. Textbook reading are important and all you really need to do. Everything in there was on the exam. Connect assignments every week which definitely will help bring up you mark.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104D,"Worst prof for my first year. He's not at all flexible with students, he's rude af and disrespectful towards students. ECO1102 is nice, but the prof is soooo bad. If there was an award for worst prof of the year, he would get it !! DO NOT TAKE HIM."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104D,"This prof has some of the best notes I have ever seen. EXTREMELY clear explanations and diagrams and he really takes his time with the material. You don't even need to read the book, his notes and lectures are detailed enough. Very clear expectations and straightforward, no trick questions. :)"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO21,Too many works too do. Always showed with a porker face with no passion about teaching at all. No respect for student and he even check student pocket before exam. Change session please.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO211,CHANGE SECTION OR DROP! THAT IS THE ONLY TWO CHOICES YOU HAVE.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2111,"This is my second time having Gordon (the first time I had him for MACRO I). I actually really liked him in this class. I found the class fair, the test easy, and the group project fun. Gordon is really funny and I found him much more laid back in this course compared to MACRO I. I am going to miss this prof!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Absolute asshole. Doesn't care about his students at all. Take the course at Carleton to avoid him, it's worth it"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Course materials were poorly conveyed and assessments were difficult. He did not give off a warm impression in class, though I did not talk to him personally. It does not surprise me that his courses do not quickly fill up, which is unfortunate, since the subject matter is interesting and useful."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"His slides are contained within lectures and does not upload them to Brightspace, making review more difficult than it needs to be. I assume this is to encourage people to watch/attend lectures, but he just reads off the slides anyways; such a goal can be achieved through having more engaging lectures."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"I feel bad about writing bad reviews because i know it must suck to be the prof reading it- but truly this class was awful. Gordon is an econ master, but has no idea how to teach it to students. VERY algebra heavy, which poses extreme difficulty for faculty of Arts Students. Exams are very hard, and not enough time to complete. AVOID if you can!!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Avoid this prof like the plague. Rushes through lectures to get the material done and skims through stuff with the assumption that we should already know it. Does not care about his students. I have no idea why the university still has him around. Knows economics, terrible teacher."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Gordon is the most arrogant and rude prof I have ever had the displeasure of having. He was condescending in his responses to students, and laughed at someone. Both midterms were too long to even be able to finish, and a majority of students failed both. I would not recommend taking this prof if there is another option for you."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,Professor Lenjosek makes his midterms ridiculously long and not enough time to complete them. His lectures are quite heavy and he does not provide notes so you should be prepared to write a lot of notes.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"The questions of the final are not that hard but the exam is unnecessarily long. You could never finish the exam unless you are extremely familiar with the contents, and even so, you might just merely finish it. It's very frustrating because I studied so hard."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"I can't pass his course no matter how hard I ve tried , his exams are ridiculously long and there is no way for students to finish on time and get a good grade. He gives you tough MP choice questions and you don't have time to do the short response question that account for more than 50% of your grades."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,I have tried to avoid taking this class with him many times but it seems like he is the only prof teaching it. not good at explaining concepts and skips so many steps when explaining a question that involves some math. had to teach myself because he was not helpful in office hours either. He does not give enough time for midterms. would not recmnd.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,SO so condescending. Laughs at students when they ask genuine questions about material. He's rude when you ask questions about testing and tells you go back to listen to the 3 hour recording when he specified that information. It's really discouraging to learn with him and he doesn't post any of his slides.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Very dry humor, very difficult to sit through an entire lecture listening to him. He gives way to long of midterm exams for the short period we are allowed to complete it, so even if you are comfortable with the material, you will feel rushed on all exams. Highly recommend avoiding him if possible"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Worst prof I've ever had a class with. His lectures are boring and his slides make no sense and are very unhelpful. His exams are absolutely ridiculous, with most of the points being weighed on the ""short answer"" questions which come in multiple confusing parts. I definitely would never take a class with this prof again."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"He can be rude sometimes which makes it difficult to ask questions in class. Going to class feels useless sometimes because he mainly reads off slides. He mislead the whole class on what was covered in the midterm and even chuckled in the following class after the midterm. He surely knows his material, just not a good prof IMO"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"I've had this guy before, ""A"" both times for higher level classes. He decided to make this class much harder than he should. Scared I will fail my first class, from a 4th year econ with 8 gpa."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Expectations were much too high for a second-year class. I am an Econ major with a 9 CGPA and somehow found this class very difficult. Although I thought Lenjosek was a good prof in a previous class, try to take 2118 with another prof if you can."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,You have to spend much money on online access code if take his class..
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,his exams are loooooooong and tough . Do not take a class with him 
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,People are overexaggerating. Yes you need to put in the work for this class but it is doable. I finished with an A and a very good understanding of the course. You need to be prepared to work for your grade but that's it. 
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"He is a horrible professor who does not care for his students whatsoever. He does not answer any question he deems stupid or unworthy, and will make fun of you for not understanding. His assignments do not reflect the exam at all, and I would heavily recommend you take this class in French. It is utterly shocking that this man is still employed."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,The worst professor I met before! Avoid his lecture!
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,Horrible professor who does not care at all about his students or their mental health. Very disappointing of uOttawa to hire someone who is so blatantly against what they claim to stand for. Would give a zero if I could.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"SORRY BUT HE IS THE WORST TEACHER EVER if you don't meet the level of a real teacher please stop teaching, because he is NEVER sure of his examples or slides whatever. if you have the choice don't take his class, biggest mistake in my scholarship"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"Excellent Prof!  If you show up to class, read the chapters, work through the problems, you will do very well in his class.  His midterms feel long, but they are actually pretty straight forward.  If you put in the work, you will get a very good grade.  I did, and I finished with an A+!!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"Arrogant and rude. Probably since he doesn't exactly know what he's talking about. Has trouble answering student questions in class about material that is not in his slides or in the manual. Doesn't like when students waste his time (in his case, asking for help or to clarify notes). Demands respect from students but gives little back."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"This prof is tough, but he is fair. He sets out really clear guidelines to what he wants and if you follow them, you'll be fine. Don't test him because he will yell at you in front of the class. I've seen it happen. The multiple choice questions on tests are made to trip you up so watch out. The short answer questions will save you from failing."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"Only did this at the end of the semester but read the lectures before going to class. Try and figure out the content before you get to lecture. His lectures go by fast, by the end you are wiped out. Tough class but do all the work, go to his office hours and practice. Read exams Qs carefully. His Qs are made to make u stumble. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"Amazing prof! Very clear notes and expectation of his students. Gives plenty of ressources for extra help. The class itself is hard, but he will do anything to help you. Very hard working and dedicated professor. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2143,"Doesnt make a great first impression, as he comes off a bit abrasive, but hes a great prof, and he is quite funny. Once you get used to his lecture style, and his sense of humor, he is a pleasure to learn from. Stern with his expectations, and doesnt like repeating himself, so its essential to pay attention. He always gives fair assessments."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2143,"He lectures very quickly, so make sure you are following along in the readings. It is a pretty hard class but if you work hard, you'll do fine."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,Is incredibly disrespectful to students. Lectures and practice questions are nothing like the assessments. Demands the utmost respect yet treats all others with contempt.  
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"had him for eco1102 and it was fine, but i think for this class he just was not super helpful and always dismissed you if you had struggles - not the worst, but definitely not good"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"Very dry sense of humour that can come across as rude/snarky, but especially one-on-one he is very nice and willing to sit with you to work through things. Essentially if you're willing to put in the work (like a lot) then it's a good course. If you respect the course and the prof there shouldn't be a problem. Tough exams, but nice detailed slides."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"Worst prof. Boring lectures. So many assignements (1 every week),. Hard exams."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,He is very disrespectful in so many levels...i don't think he understands that students are stupid to not know something already? if we know something t we wouldn't be paying for all that tuition so yeah students come to school to learn!! he gets annoyed by asking simple questions that you don't know already..
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"Awesome, fair prof who cares and wants his student to get great marks. He really knows his stuff and prepares excellent slide notes. If you attend class and are serious about studying you can do well in his course!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"He complicates the concepts for nothing, lectures are very boring exam are hard. Very rude"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,Great lecture notes! Very clear on his expectations and extremely helpful when asked questions.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,He made the class interesting and fun and always answered any student questions during class. I didn't need to use the textbook but studied from his power point slides notes.  His testsexam exactly followed his outline and class notes. Lots of material covered during lectures but saves time from having to read the book. Take good notes in class.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"He believes he's smarter than everybody else but, ironically, he's not good at explaining the subject. This course is a big change from the introductory course in Microeconomics and needed to have a better qualified Professor. He laughs at you if you ask anything that he thinks it's easy but that just shows a mix of arrogance and insecurity."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"I liked his intro to macro, and decided to follow him. However, his lecture notes in macro theory are really dispersed. You need to do text reading and go to the lecture in order to understand the materials. :- Exams are hard. Some tricks of the wording. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"If you have questions, he's very helpful, but he has unrealistic expectations. Both midterms the class average was in the 40s. "
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,Greatest Eco prof ever!!! You will learn a lot from him. Although the lecture is kinda boring but it is so useful for future study!
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"His test is too long to be finished. He is not showing respect. He is not sharing any notes and materials. He is using adove connect and all of his lectures are having some technical problems. For example, no voice for a while or graph stack for a while. So he is the worst ECO prof ever, don't take his course!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"His test is too long to be finished. He is not showing respect. He is not sharing any notes and materials. He is using adove connect and all of his lectures are having some technical problems. Like no voice for a while or graph stack for a while. So he is the worst ECO prof ever, don't take his course!!!!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"Hands down the worst professor I have ever had. It is difficult to ask him questions because he is extremely rude. Super unclear with his feedback and his midterms and impossible to finish in an ""attempt to reduce cheating"", but then said people did too well and lowered their marks with no actual proof. Avoid at all costs"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"What kind of prof takes 10+ points (2 letter grades) off the class midterm grades 3 days before the final exam? Unfair grading scheme. Hed belittle us when we asked questions in class, he really doesnt like students. Final was a nightmare. Never had a class/prof give me this much anxiety before. You couldnt pay me to take class with him again."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"This is coming from an econ major with a 9.5GPA who loves their field... this was the worst class Ive ever taken. Final exam was near impossible. Ive never seen a prof get seemingly angry when his students do well? The exams are hard + hes the strictest marker Ive ever encountered. I do not recommend, he should NOT be teaching. TAs were nice tho"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"He drops your grade because he does not think you can get it, my mark of midterm 2 went down 15% because he said it was impossible to get that high without cheating. He does not provide lecture notes on brightspace but he would say they are visible in the recordings."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"This prof is rude and snarky. He doesn't seem to care whether his students succeed or not. He does what's easiest for him, and any questions or challenges students run into are their fault and not his problem. His teaching style is dry and impossible to follow. I do not recommend it."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"He was one of the worst profs I've ever had. So rude and arrogant and very unapproachable. He only posts ""select"" lecture slides meaning only slides with math on them but none of his slides with the actual content. Isn't a very good lecturer, and will stop teaching almost every class to yell at someone who uses their phone. I'd avoid him."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145A,"no slides. exams so hard, when get high grade, he will drop the grade because he thinks you cheating. Lol just he thinks ..."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO3149,"One of those teachers whose notes (slides) are more clear and comprehensive than the textbook. He has high expectations (it's a 3rd year course after all) and his assignments ask for a thorough understanding of the material, which makes attendance important. Awesome teacher (loved his sense of humor). Great class. If you work hard, you will ace it!"
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO3149,Has unrealistic expectations on exams and assignments.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECO3149,Worst class avoid at all costs trust me
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECON1104,Such a rude man. Went into his teacher hours on zoom to ask a simple question on where i could find something and he straight up laughed in my face.
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECON1104,"He does not post his lecture notes and he goes through the slides super fast, but I found that his tests were based off of the material in the textbook. I went to about 4 classes throughout the semester and found it was a waste of time. If you study and understand the textbook and do his practise tests you will be fine."
University of Ottawa,Gordon Lenjosek,ECON1104,Pretty much the straight forward kind of guy. Just pay attention in class since almost everything he says is practically what is on the exam.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO,"Too hot to focus don't even get me started when she starts talking about neurons, oww oww I know what else jumps like saltatory conduction!  All in all not a bad prof."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1109,"She gives good (recorded) lectures. She does her best to keep the students active in class. She also effectively makes any topic interesting. However, be ready to work for your marks. The course is very textbook heavy; get ready to read! I also found her exams to be quite hard. She is an overall good professor and I enjoyed my time in her class."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1109,"Do your readings! There's A LOT of material and she doesn't really teach it so much as review the readings. Participation marks with Lecture Tools are easy marks  and she posts podcasts of all the lectures so technically you don't have to go, though I suggest you do. Assignments are fair but midterm and final are specific to textbook material."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,im writing the exam rn and its some of the hardest stuff ive ever done. shes nice but omg the midterms and the exams just aint it. it isnt worth it i wish i dropped out.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,No over-exaggeration. Changed the course of my entire life for the worst. She is the worst thing that ever happened to me. I hope she loses sleep at night for being honestly such a terrible person. I'm writing this 6 years after I took her class (I forgot this website existed and had to come back to warn the masses).
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,she is the worst grader ever
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The material is not hard, but she demands EXACT wording, which makes exams exponentially harder than they should be. Midterm average was 35% before the bellcurve. Often asks questions for material that was never taught. I dedicated more time to this class than my other four combined and STILL almost failed. Worst prof I've had by far."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The class material is not that difficult, but she is a tough grader and words her test questions in a weird way which makes the tests harder than they should be... She also teaches like a high school teacher which I didn't't like, and makes you do weird group activities."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Had her last year and ended up dropping the course because she expects you to know the material before coming into class. She seems to be the only prof who teaches this course too. The participation questions she would have on echo would be on things that were never learned in the lectures previously.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Honestly, this was a pretty difficult course but not nearly as difficult as people make it out to be. Just take notes in class and study a couple days before the midterm. I didn't do a single one of the readings and it did not affect my grade. Her lectures were decent and she posted them as podcasts. Lots of online tests though, but they're easy."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Teaching is fine, talks slow, posts videos of lectures  super helpful BUT exams have nothing to do with what you learn in class"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I would not recommend her, she is a tough grader and it is difficult to meet her criteria. I know many people who dropped the course because of her and some who failed."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Only prof that teaches BIO1140 so you don't really have another choice for a prof. Does not teach in her lectures and she expects you to know the material before class. Just get the course done with, it'll be your lowest mark even though its the course you spend the most time on."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Lectures are mandatory but useless, you could study everything in the textbook and slides and still wouldn't be prepared for the mess of an exams or midterm that she has prepared. Incredibly tough grader and there are always surprises on her tests. Steer clear of this one..."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Lectures and teaching method took some getting use to. She will give you the general gist of what you need to know in her lectures but reading is required if you want a cohesive and in-depth understanding of the material. Lots of small assignments that require weekly work (online quizzes & sapling). An older version of the textbook works.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Still haunts me everyday...
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I am a hard working student and dedicated MANY hours to this class over the semester. Unfortunately, the midterms and exam were much harder than expected. Most of the content is a review/build on grade 12 biology, however, the way she tests her students was unfair. No matter how much you study, be prepared to not end with the grade you hope for."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,THANK GOD SHE QUIT. SHE IS NO LONGER AT uOTTAWA. THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,It is the worst class I ever took in life. Wish there was another professor who taught BIO1140. You think you did good on your midterms and exams until you find out your mark.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She's not a terrible person, but just a terrible prof. Tests seemed okay, but then her marking scheme is some next level answers that nobody would have thought of, which messes everyone's deserved grades. Do all the assignments and do well on the labs. I hope she never teaches this course again."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Make sure you play Biolingo EVERY SINGLE DAY OF YOUR LIFE or else you won't get the 5% cus she completely screwed the entire class up by changing the syllabus halfway through the semester. Horrible prof.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Don't write word for word what she wants? Expect low. Most difficult class I've experienced.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"One of the worst profs I've ever had. Had Chapleau last semester so I thought this class might be just as good. Nope. You think you're confident before the exam until you see the questions which makes no sense. Speaking of making no sense, her marking scheme is so confusing. Avoid her or your participation and lab marks are your saving grace."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,The worst prof I have ever had at UOttawa. I found that I had to read the textbook all the time because her explanations were horrible. Every time I went to her lectures I felt like I absorbed nothing. She puts nothing on her slides which becomes a nightmare especially when studying all the specific pathways. Just horrible!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The readings and lectures might give you a false sense of confidence, but the marking scheme on the exams are nothing short of an enigma."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"she is the worst prof in the history of profs. her teaching style is terrible, says the textbook is essential but nothing from it helps, midterms and exams are marked in such a way it is sooo difficult to succeed; if you do good and youre not a super genius it was chance. she needs to be gone"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Has to read textbook (sometimes long chapters) before going to class in order to understand what she is saying
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Exam question: what is your name? (1 mark) Your answer: Joe Doe Marking scheme: (0.5 for the student age; 0.5 for the student number; zero if they only include their names) that's how she marks the exams. She asks direct question and looks for irreverent answers.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"one of the worst at uOttawa for sure. She doesn't teach, but tests you on. everything. Extraterrestrial marking scheme."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I have taken this class before at a different university and received an 85. In this course I will get maybe 65. Her expectations for a first year course are too high. Expect 3x the workload as other classes, including daily ""fun quizzes"" which are definitely not fun at all. Don't take this class with her, take it somewhere else, seriously."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Honestly her grading criteria makes no sense. You can walk out of the exam thinking you did alright and get a low mark. Her lectures are very disorganized and exam questions are wayy beyond the scope of the course. Try to do really well in the lab and get all the participation marks to hopefully boost your mark a little!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"To everyone reading this because there mad and fed up with her bs, please complain to the school. Go over her pay grade, its the only for things to change!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,90% of the material in the course must be self-taught. She expects students to teach other in lectures. Exams contain material that was never talked about in the lectures or even textbook. Buy the textbook if you want a chance in the course
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Avoid at all costs. I'm actually not kidding, if you speak french, take the french section. I've heard its a lot better. She loves interactive learning, and none of it is helpful. doesn't teach anything in the lectures, impossible to know what to expect on the exams, doesn't grade or make questions fairly. She's also condescending and rude"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"midterms and exams consist of things that have not been covered, She is horrible at responding to questions, changes syllabus and the rules, horrible at responding to questions, horrible lectures, leaves everyone confused after lectures. She is a nice person but a horrible teacher, you are better off just studying on your own."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Does not know how to teach, makes students speak into the microphone instead of teaching concepts herself. People only attend for the participation marks as her lectures are useless. Her slides and explanations are vague and expects students to know every detail on exams. Avoid!!!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I somehow got an 85 on the first midterm when the average was 70. I studied the exact same way for the second midterm and got a 69, with the long answer portion being a 54%. ?"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,She is knowledgable and a great professor
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,don't ever take this prof for anything. she doesn't know how to teach properly; only talks about the basics and then expects everyone to know every detail for the exams. the slides are useless and people only attend for participation marks. please avoid. the class averages every year are so low for this teacher.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I was warned about the tough time I'll have to succeed in this course. So I did all the textbook readings, went to every class, actively participated, but for what? Only to be hit with questions on material that were in neither. Always thought that a hard prof simply wasn't hard if you work hard enough and do everything they say. Guess I was wrong."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Dr. Turcotte actually lived up to the hype. Never did I think that a professor could be this bad. Touches the surface on material in class, just enough for us to know the basics but setting us up for a ridiculous trick question on the midterm. Comes up with hypothetical 10 mark questions from the top of her head that make absolutely no sense."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Honestly the worst prof I've ever had. 3 months into the course and I have not learned a thing from her. She basically uses 1.5 hours of class time to give you a VERY brief summary of things you need to know. You have to construct all the content to study yourself based on her vague lectures which have no actual content.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,My midterm is on Tuesday and I still don't know what to study.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She uses Active Learning in her lectures. Much time is wasted on each slide, as she asks the class questions to prompt her to expand on the slide, yet changes her explanation multiple times to fill up class time. Each Active Learning question puts about 6 minutes of break time in the class, which is her way of filling up the lecture class time."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Makes life difficult for no reason. IDK why she's the only professor for the course. UOttawa needs to get it together.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Probably the worst prof I've ever had. Her ""teaching"" style is basically making you read the textbook and then asking students in class to explain the concepts themselves instead of going into detail herself. Barely any of the readings assigned correspond to her lecture material and her exams are wayyy too hard. I would avoid her at all costs."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her course is the main reason that made me switch from biology! Awful prof, the worst ever. Students shouldnt be experimental subjects for your Active Learning researches!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"When she is lecturing, if you listen very carefully to what she is saying, she is repeating the same concept over and over again but rewording it (which confuses the students because they think it is a new thing but it isn't!). The result of her repeating everything ends up taking her 30 min to finish 1 slide when it could have been done in 10 min."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,she uses an 'active learning style' that other profs don't use. But there's a reason other profs do things differently; her students leave her class confused and feeling like it was a waste of time. She should teach instead of asking her students questions and then not telling us the right answer! May as well just teach yourself from the textbook.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Throughout history, it's been the tradition that the student learns from the teacher as it pertains to gaining knowledge. Unfortunately, an ideal comparison to the student-teacher interaction in this course is lagging Wi-Fi connection. Hard to follow in class, and not to mention bad marking schemes. Which makes for passing the torch impossible."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Dr. Turcotte is great as a person. With that being said, she is just brutal on exams. I honestly think that she is taking away the beauty of biology for most students. Hopefully, uOttawa will decide something soon as courses like these are what make people avoid studying here."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,im sorry if u have to take this class hopefully they get a new prof for u froshies next year
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Shame on the University of Ottawa for turning a blind eye to the current situation with this professor. It is not fair for the students to be paying thousands of dollars in tuition to receive a prof who is entitled and unfair towards the students. She is very rude and creates the midterm in a way to make you fail miserably on purpose.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,A lot of her questions in the exams are stuff that aren't.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Explains decently in class, but marks her midterms way too harshly. Her expectations before and after the exams aren't clear at all, her way or the highway, makes us guess all the time. Supposed to be an easy class, but she makes it way too hard for nothing. I don't recommend her at all.."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,bad explanations and bad marking scheme. avoid her if you can..
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She doesn't explain to well, Recommend to read the text book and study in group to pass.."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Don't appreciate how harsh her marking is.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I have no idea how she is allowed to teach. She is the worst professor I ever had and will ever have. She treats us like 5 year olds in class, skims the surface of a very challenging topic, and then makes us go teach the rest ourselves. Terrible marking scheme, 25% of people failed the first midterm, the majority got 50-60% and she thinks it's good"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Really rude teacher, and really bad at marking papers."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Marking schemes are completely random, you'll think u did well but end up with a low mark."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Nothing in her slide shows correlate with the reading material she assigns yet 90% of whats on the midterm is based off of the readings!!!! Read, read, read if you're in her class."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,She is the worst prof I've ever had. Doesn't teach any concepts properly and then screws u for it on the exams. You have to literally write exactly on what SHE thinks is right. I don't get how this school has made her the ONLY prof for this mandatory course. I would drop my degree if I have to take her again. She is the worst part about uottawa.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I would tell you to avoid this prof, but unfortunately she is the ONLY one who teaches it so buckle up your seat belts and get ready to SUFFER. She thinks she is doing you a favour with active learning, but I'd beg to differ. If you don't do the readings honestly gl, she barely lectures. I pity all y'all who gotta take this course."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"""get ready to read"" is an understatement. You will have to teach yourself every single concept and do so much work outside of the lecture. Extremely hard marker and will not teach, only says ""you have to know this"" and then finishes the lecture early... would be an amazing class if you didn't have to act like the professor"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Instead of lecturing, she gets you to learn the material from her readings that are very difficult to understand, and then spends the class doing application questions. This 'flipped classroom' sounds doable at first, but the way she does it is very ineffective and I felt did not prepare me for the exams. Try and find old exams to practice!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She says that readings are mandatory, but they really aren't. I got an A+ in this class without EVER doing the assigned readings or watching the assigned videos. She only grades on the information she talks about in class and on her slides. For midterms and exams, she barely changes them year after year."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"SO many readings, and they don't make sense, don't bother with them. Her lectures are not really lectures and a lot of waiting around for people to answer questions under the assumption that people did the readings. You don't really need to go to lectures because she uploads the videos online, just study from the lectures and you should be fine."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Probably  one of the worst  professors I have ever had. She takes a simple introductory class and complicates It way more than necessary. Also she literally serves no purpose, she doesn't teach you at all and expects the students to discuss and do her job for her .  Oh Don't forget that all her midterms are on weekends, and she doesn't even show"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The only way to really pass this class is to use her powerpoints as a guide on the content and fill in all the information using her podcasts. When you study, prepare for any open ended questions possible and learn her answer by virbatum to get full marks.  Do your labs and participation because thats the only way you can save your grade"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"At the beginning of the semester she'll make you believe that her class is going to be better than normal lectures. It isn't, it is much worse. She really can't teach and her exams are ridiculous. You might think you did ok on an exam and your answer might be right but if it doesn't fit her bizarre marking scheme, too bad. AVOID and save your GPA"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"In general, don't bother with the readings unless she specifically tells you that a portion will be on the midterm. Focus on what she says in the lectures/podcasts; the tests will centre on that. Very picky about marking criteria. Needs to stop with the new-age 'learning session' stuff and just lecture, because it's only making her teaching worse."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Look at past midterms!! To really boost your grade up, make sure you do well on the labs because that portion of the course will save you.  Listen to her podcasts and make sure you know all the concepts taught in the lecture. The readings she assigned are not helpful at all so don't bother with them."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Readings are a waste of time. Memorize everything in the slides and any information she talks about and you should be good. Her exams are all about THE KEYWORDS. Memorize the specific names of the structures and the names of everything because that's what she cares about.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Ok, so she was awful I'm sure you've gathered that. But I beg you if you must take this course; the readings DO NOT matter. You will waste so much time with the readings, but I swear save yourself so much stress and stick to the podcasts and look at the readings if you don't understand or if she specifically alludes to them.  Best of luck."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"For this class, all you need to do is watch the podcasts. Pre-class readings? - a whole bunch of stuff maybe helpful during the class, but not in the exams. Don't kill yourself if you cant make it to class, watch the podcast, WRITE DOWN EVERYTHING she says in the podcasts. Everything she needs you to know is what she says in class, in the podcast!!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Dr. Petit-Turcotte is actually not a bad professor. She makes the effort to provide all the resources needed to succeed in the course. Attend lectures for easy 10%, follow the learning objectives RELIGIOUSLY, listen to the recorded lecture (goes over LO) & ace your labs (they aren't hard). This class is work but very possible to do well! Good luck!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her marking schemes are very specific, but once you know exactly what she wants, you are able to do well. The first midterm was very easy, the second midterm was absolute hell. The final was easier than the second midterm. She is a nice  person to talk to, and going to her office hours is easy."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,People say she doesn't lecture and just asks questions. Nonsense. Don't take notes during class. Participate and understand. Watch lectures online to take notes. Between her lectures and lecture slides you can find 75% of the exam content.  The rest comes from a deeper understanding of the content. Tons of work but that's the nature of biology
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Be prepared to work, don't bother with online readings or learning objectives, just make notes on what she says in what she calls lectures ('learning sessions'??). Be prepared for hard midterms and exam, you definitely cannot start studying the night or even a couple nights before."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Make notes based off the objectives and be on top of it after each topic and make sure to have enough details for them; they are basically what she will test you on. No need to read online readings. Midterms are a bit tricky but fair if you understand the material and can make connections. Marking scheme is tough, look at past midterms:)"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Not an easy class content-wise, but if you prepare for tests far in advance you'll be fine. Need to find old tests because she doesn't provide them, you won't get marks unless you write it her way. Lectures are interactive not the prof talking at you which is nice. She's a good prof, just the course content and marking scheme/time given is tough."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,exams are longer than given time. very low average for the entire class. prof to present during midterm.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She's not as bad as everyone is making her out to be. Yeah, the midterm average was 45% but I rewatched her lectures on Echo, did the readings and made concise notes and pulled of an 89%. It's not a class you can cram for, start studying two weeks in advance. She actually tells you what you need to know but you have to listen carefully."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Honestly I've never had a worse professor. Her marking scheme is ridiculously unfair and she does not prepare you for midterms or final exams. Our second midterm average was a 36% and she refused to curve it to a passing grade. Basically relies on other students to teach the class for her. Avoid her at all costs if you want to pass!!!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Worst prof all year. Read the other reviews but basically she expects you to know everything before class and then just asks questions. Get ready to teach yourself the material and study hardddd because her grading schemes are unfair (worse than Houseman's)! Avoid her if you can.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her readings are not very efficient and are too vague. She is very caring and will help you find the best METHOD of studying. Watch youtube videos and make sure your studying incorporates all her objectives.. PRACTICEEEEE her exams beforehand, her marking schemes are tough and so you have to learn how to answer her question even if you know it all."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Read everyone else's reviews for this prof. They are true. This course is painful.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her teaching style didn't work for me. She does not lecture. She stands at the front of the class and asks students questions. She expects you to do massive readings and know everything before class. The marking scheme is too specific, as the amount of knowledge is vast and vague. Would recommend avoiding, unless you like reading."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,The worst prof I've ever had in 4 years (2nd degree). Her marking schemes are so specific it's almost impossible to do good. Class average for midterm 2 was 45% and that's with a curve. She claims you just need to know the learning objectives to do good but her tests are barely related to those topics. Avoid at all costs!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Study as much as you want but it is extremely hard to do well on exams/ midterms. Questions are always very vague and grading is so very specific. Lectures are interesting and so is the content; however, professor makes it very difficult to keep up with all the heavy readings and succeed."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The amount of information she expects you to absorb BEFORE attending each lecture is ridiculous. During the lecture, all she does is ask questions and waits for the students to answer. I was so confused throughout the entire course. Her exams are painful. She's a tough marker. If you care about your grades, avoid this prof."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,This prof has the potential to be an amazing prof BUT all her readings are online and they DO NOT make sense whats so ever and you are blindly reading them with no directions as to what you need to learn because she barely teaches any of the material. This class will make you want to rip your hairs out because you are going into exams blind. Avoid
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Funny how the teacher that does ""pedagogical research"" is the worst pedagogue I've had in university. Simply terrible."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Comes off as nice and friendly however does not teach at all, her ""learning sessions"" are useless.... do not cover even a third of what you need to learn. She expects you to read documents online, and doesn't think you have any other classes. Doesn't give you any guide lines or expectations. If you have to take her that really sucks ."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Have a suspicion she knows very little about what she teaches as she dose not even teach, she makes you read online documents, worst teacher by far"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Comes off as nice, but has absurd expectations, considering the fact that she doesn't teach at all. She tries to be way too interactive with the lecture, and spends the whole class answering only a few questions. She gives you huge amounts of readings, yet almost no direction or clear idea what you need to know. If possible, avoid at all costs."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,You have to take her if you take this course but she's possibly the WORST prof ever. Teaches the absolute basics and then (judging from previous exams online) puts the most nit-picky details on the exams. Really needs to stop trying to be so interactive and JUST LECTURE.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Absolutely terrible. Doesn't teach, and doesn't facilitate. She believes she has the authority to give her class triple the workload of any other university class, and she doesn't care (for does the faculty for that matter)."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Gave us 10% for attendance. GO TO CLASS - you'll need that 10%. Nice lady and passionate about biology, but sort of relies on students to teach for her. Tries to be too interactive - wish she had taken more time to just LECTURE rather than asking the class so many interactive questions. Tons of material - know your stuff and do the readings."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"A lot of people found this class hard, but you really just need to listen and take good notes on the ppts in class, and then know EVERYTHING from the ppts. (Go to the dgds, and practice answering the learning objectives)."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Energetic and obviously loves biology, however she doesn't really know how to teach.  Barely need the textbook. You can still get participation marks even if you don't actually show up. You go into  midterms and the final blind as to what you really need to know and what you don't. Looks for specific terms/descriptions when marking."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Houseman 2.0  Comes off as nice but her midterms are so specific, at least Houseman said that you need to know everything. She says that you don't need to know everything, and will put everything on the midterms so be prepared to memorize."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,She comes off as nice and wanting to help her students but her exams really do not reflect this at all. Exams are tough and you really need to know EVERYTHING that she teaches in her lectures. I ended up with an A in the course mainly by religiously following the objectives she gave at the beginning of the course. Also go to the dgds!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"To do well, all you have to do is listen in class (take DETAILED notes here) and watch podcasts (fill gaps from notes and just listen). And don't read, everything you need to know is in her lectures, only read about the learning objectives she doesn't cover in class. Understand topics and link them together with a group of friends. Good luck :)"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Decent lecturer, however make sure you do your readings before the lecture or else it will be a struggle to understand the specifics of some concepts. Her marking schemes for midterms and exams are ridiculously specific so try your best to memorize her exact wording. Participation and the lab component are your best bet to save your grade."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her course is really hard, and she doesn't sugarcoat it either. Really pay attention, do the assigned readings and study hard. Her first midterm is easy, but don't be fooled by it, the second midterm is a disaster. In my opinion it was a terrible ""wake up call."" However, she actually does teach the new material."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Makes you do your readings before class-do them at some point before the exam. Quizzes during lectures are an easy 5% so participate. Hated teaching style- was all ""you, student, tell me about ___"" instead of teaching it herself. Exams very specific for the marking scheme. Labs were easy and fun. DONT TAKE IF YOU DONT NEED IT. Very nice lady though"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Participation and Lab's will save your mark. The course was interesting but midterms and final exams have so much content and the marking schemes are ridiculous to put it lightly. Memorize everything and watch  the podcasts and write down everything. Write down everything you know on the topic when it comes to midterm questions!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"BIO1140 contains a lot of information and that means that she expects literally everything in the long answer questions. I found her midterms and the final very fair. Study using the course objectives because they are very helpful and if she gives an ALP, make sure to do it because it will come out on the exams. Go to her office hours! They help."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She just asks questions during the lectures and doesn't really explain the content of the course. If you read the textbook and go to the dgds going to the lectures won't matter. I only went to the lectures for the participation marks. Don't use synonyms on tests, even if your answer means the same thing it will be marked wrong."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"AVOID this professor. The overly specific marking scheme makes it extremely difficult to do well, even if you have mastered the material. If you question the grading and she will deduct marks. Classes consist of the prof quizzing the class on concepts she hasn't yet taught, so you spend hours listening to others make wrong guesses."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She lies, BIO1140 IS ABSOLUTELY A MEMORIZATION COURSE!! She does not just quiz the concepts! You leave the exam happy because the questions seemed fair, only the get absolutely destroyed because of the marking scheme, which is INCREDIBLY specific. Despite this I actually found her lectures to be very good, and her as an educator to be very good."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"This class is incredibly hard, so get ready for long hours of crying over podcasts and textbooks. DO THE READINGS!! Her marking schemes are ridiculously specific, making it hard to get a good mark even if you know the material. Half my class failed the 2nd midterm but she wouldn't take any responsibility for this and completely blamed the class."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Absolutely hated this prof! Her lectures are so unclear, and she gives you super long readings, assuming that this is the only course you are taking. You seriously don't know what to study for the midterms/final. Take the course in French or go to Carleton it will legit save your GPA! I hope I never see her again."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"If you can get your hands on any old midterms, pay attention to the marking schemes. The marking is very, very specific. Sometimes points for the long answer questions will include things that weren't directly addressed in the question, so be sure to include anything even remotely relevant in your answer. Do your readings before class, it helps."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,She's a pretty good lecturer and she's very nice. The midterms and final exam weren't that bad but her marking scheme was pathetic which resulted in a lot of people failing her tests. You have to put a bit more effort into this class if you want an A.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Absolute worst teacher I'v had in my life and this isn't because her class is hard or she gave to much work I was fully prepared for her class but the final exam is what kills you went from 85 for both to a 59 on the final she curved it by 13% for every student and still her class average was 56%.... Simply put houseman is an angel to this lady
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Tip from someone who dropped second year, took it third year and got an A: Get ""Becker's World of the Cell"", course textbook is not enough. Use course objectives as study guides, she actually goes by them. course requires a lot of work, wait it out if you're not ready.  It's a mix of memorizing, and understanding so that then you can make links."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Gets paid to ask questions and basically have the students teach the course. Marking schemes are specific: miss a word or use a synonym, and you WON'T get the mark. Ex: I talked about lipid rafts, made of sphingolipids and cholesterol, to accommodate long transmembrane domains and I got a mark off for not saying that lipid rafts are microdomains."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,i feel bad for you first years. she's teaching 1140 and possibly 1130. she's very hard marker and her second midterm 50% of the class failed. material is a lot and she docent specify what she wants you to know. mcq is a breeze but written question are a struggle. read everything!!!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The material is easy and the exams are easy, its her marking scheme that is ridiculous. like it defeats the purpose if you are marked wrong for an answer when it has the same meaning just not identical to her marking scheme. ya i didnt like this course and gave it minimal effort i feel bad that the first years this year are stressing from it"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"This is not an easy course, if you are not ready to put the time into it, I'd suggest waiting to take it. She is such a nice lady, always in a good mood, really wants you to understand the material. Not gonna lie, her tests are tough. PUT THE TIME, ASK QUESTIONS, GO TO CLASS, READ THE BOOK. You'll do fine!!!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Bio1140 Is a course that has a lot of information to start off with. She is a very good lecturer if you go to class and take good notes. The questions that shes asks and answers are helpful in many ways. She is always open to answer questions if needed and she gives you everything needed to do well in the class. Overall, hard class and tough exams."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"good lecturer but testing methods are horrific. constantly tells you the class is not a memorization course (stop this doesn't help, biology will always be about memorization there's nothing wrong with that) yet her marking scenes are incredibly specific. Tests are less straightforward than other profs tests I've seen"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"This is actually the worst class i have ever taken. your answer could be and is right but if you dont use her own words, forget the mark. questions are worth alot (10,6,4 marks) so if you mess one question you know what happens.  this class gave me anxiety and im stressed 24/7 and the prof is not much of a help. shes unclear and all over the place."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Like many have said, if you want yourself and your GPA to survive another semester- do not take her. 47% of the class got below a 50 on the second midterm she doesn't care (plus she doesn't believe in bell curving.. :)) has SUPER unrealistic expectations for the midterms/final. ""Not a memorization course"" Yet must memorize everything WORD FOR WORD."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,I really dont know what to say she crushed me in every possible way. shes confusing and if you go to class your tim is wasted listing to her ask questions and wait for someone to answer. i wtch podcasts to skip this. the class average is very low. alot of people failed. DONT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS TO ANYONE. im an A student but this was hell
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"This prof is the worst prof i have had this year, she has made such a beautiful subject way harder then it needs to be. She puts a question on the midterm that she spoke about for 5 minutes in one lecture and makes it worth 10 points. Her expectations are very unrealistic. Do well on the labs and hope for the best!!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE  47% of people got below a 50 on the midterm. Claims midterm is not hard by looking at the 5% outliers (which is statistically insignificant). Draws a line of best fit that has a 100% deviation to tell us about studying. Claims that 10% participation marks is the same as simply adding 10% to your mark). TheWORST prof ive had
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The amount of material is course is insane, the final is cumulative, and the pathways are all pretty much all just a bunch of letters. She's good for 1109, but her markers will destroy you in 1140. There is no way around this unless you take 1140 during the summer, so I suggest you do that."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Lectures are awful, she doesn't teach anything and basically just asks questions. Tests are incredibly tough and marked unfairly.  Lab is a joke (even though this isn't her fault). Marks for attendance. Entire class  (500 + students) is about to fail her course. Avoid like the plague or kiss your GPA goodbye!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The test are pretty tough. She is also all over the place with her lecture, making it difficult to follow. Made bio harder than it is supposed to be. Textbook isn't detailed enough so that adds to the problem. I don't recommend her tbh!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She is THE WORST. She refuses to accept criticism on her marking scheme. She wants you to read her mind in order for you to do well. She asks a question about function, will except a response about something else entirely. When only 30% is getting above 60, it's not because the class is ""lazy"" (her words!), it's because OF YOUR TEST."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Awful prof, she doesn't lecture during her lectures... instead she asks questions and has us answer them. Midterms were completely unfair and unreasonable (class average clearly reflected that). Houseman was 10x better than her, switch out if you can, otherwise get ready to watch your average drop."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Tests are tough. If you are struggling with the material, go see her in her office hours, she really does care about the students' learning, contrary to popular belief. Textbook is crucial... Do the readings and make sure that you are able to relate every single topic to one another... She was okay, but I honestly preferred Houseman better..."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her lectures are really great and helpful and the ALP for participation marks was a great idea. But, her exams are brutal and don't reflect the questions that were done in class. Still, if i could have chosen another prof i would have."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"If you do all your readings before class and go to the lectures, and watch the podcasts multiple times you can do great. Although this is physically impossible as a science student. Pretty great proff, gives learning objectives so you know exactly what to study. Course is very organized. But you really have to put in the time- regrets I have."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"TRY TO AVOID AT ALL COST!! Lectures are easy to understand but there is a lot of reading about stuff she doesn't mention in class, exams are very tough. She gives 10% participation marks but then gives you hard midterms."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,BAD lectures. She tries to get the class involved and it ends horribly.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Most confusing professor I've had so far. Does not teach things in order (i.e., won't teach the steps of a cellular process in the actual order they occur). She does not cover much during the lecture, so you will have to read the textbook thoroughly. The material is interesting, she just teaches it so poorly."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I'm sick and tired of people saying that they got a bad mark because they relied on podcasts. Everyone is different and learns differently. Just because you listen to podcasts and not show up to her class (which is pretty useless), doesn't mean you'll end up with a C. I did much better taking my time and pausing. She's a horrible prof so far."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"she'll tell you every class that there's no need for memorization,  tell you that you don't need to memorize all 20 amino acids, then ask you to build a protein out of 10 amino acids, not give the answer in the class because no one had done it, then have her hint at it being on the upcoming midterm meaning you NEED to memorize. RIP"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Caroline doesn't do the grading, but her markers will massacre you. You can't use synonyms (so use the EXACT PHRASES she uses). Objectives are helpful. Know everything in the most detail as possible. I studied a lot and it paid off (midterm 1 got a 79 which killed me but ended the course with an A+). Know pathways really well and she loves Ca+2"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"In retrospect, if I attended the lectures (rather than relying solely on the podcasts) and attended the DGDs I could have done quite well in this class. Alas, I did not... The answers she expects on her exams can be specific at times, but some are forgiving, a mix of both. The lab component and the participation marks are a life saver. Brutal final"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She was difficult to understand at times because she didn't tell you the info in chronological order. I had to clue in and put what she said in the middle of the explanation at the beginning and put what she said last in the middle, etc. If you study and are dedicated you will do well. The tests aren't difficult but rather she is a picky marker. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I found this prof super funny. The material in class is very simple and seems easy, but you should read your textbook to get a deeper explanation of concepts. She asks so many questions in class as LectureTools is a big deal for her (she also waits until someone answers...). Easy labs. Interesting course!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Great prof. Her lectures are pretty amazing. Explains things in detail and goes over them several times to make sure everyone got it. Encourages you to ask questions and is more than happy to address them during class. She's a very kind and helpful person. Most of her tests are from the lectures.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"In BIO1140, be prepared to rewatch podcasts, attend lectures, read the textbook AND search online for all the information on each topic because you won't  be able to find complete information from any one of them alone. She's a nice lady who is definitely willing to help you but her lectures can be messy and confusing. Study off the course outline."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,she is a very sweet woman! pretty good lecturer too! not as bad as everyone says she is. tests were pretty tough but not impossible. she encourages you to participate which is good :) 
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I did see a some generosity wt Dr. Caroline's marking scheme vs. Houseman.  She cares about passing students, she loves to teach and makes lectures interactive.  She's cool, but can trick you easily on tests.  GO to the optional DGDs!! Watch each podcast twice before exams.  Make comparison tables and Q-cards!!! SO important!!!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I was really looking forward to BIO1140. To be honest, the lectures were quite good; she explains concepts well and she will go over things again if you raise your hand and ask. However, her midterms are BRUTAL. Very picky marking schemes. Be sure to use HER wording for answering on exams. No need to buy the textbook. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her exams are very fair in terms of content and questions. Her marking scheme for long questions are tough. The key to getting an A+ in this course is re watching the podcasts and taking down the key points, no need to buy textbook."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Her marking scheme is horrible. She is a nice person but she is not a good teacher. She can't explain things very well and she is constantly asking question from student which is super distracting. Common on if we know the answer of your questions we would not take the course. She jumps through the material which makes it really hard to take notes.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Listen in class, answer questions, re-watch podcasts and make notes next to each slide, do practice problems posted in DGDs. No need to read textbook. Be sure to write super-specific answers on the midterm and final because there are no bell-curves and she expects you to write the exact word required aka word vomit. Very interesting course though."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Focus on CLASS material, not the readings she gives! Don't waste your time on the additional readings instead get every word she says down (even if you have to re watch podcasts). The key to an A is regurgitating every thing she has said! The lab exam is weird, its more based off of thing you actually did saw in the lab rather than theory!goodluck"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"would seriously have avoided if i knew how ridiculous her marking schemes were even houseman was better than her, and that's saying something really made me hate bio with a passion"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,loved her tbh
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Absolute worst prof, do not take her under any circumstances. Spends the entire lecture asking condescending questions about things we haven't even learned, speeds thru the material at an unreasonably fast pace, then spends a whole bunch of time cracking stupid jokes. Terrible, just awful."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Absolutely brutal prof, but I guess you only have her because you have to. There's no trick to this courseprof: just study everything like crazy to get a good grade or accept that it's probably not worth the effort."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Dr. Petit-Turcotte was my favourite prof of first year. She was so helpful when you needed help and she was always willing to meet you, or answer emails outside of class and her office hours. If you studied,the midterms were really not that hard and overall very fair! Just go to class, take notes on what she says, and really UNDERSTAND everything!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"The first strike was the huge amount of reading at the start of the course, that were never on any of the tests. The 2nd one was the tough questions during class, BEFORE a concept was explained, that really made me feel stupid:( strike #3 LONG EXAMS. She says the questions are based on integration, yet the exams have too many questions and no time?"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She goes into detail about everything... She can go a little fast sometimes but you can watch podcasts. I would say in order to do well in her class, you have to expand from your notes and try to relate or bring several concepts together. The only thing is that sometimes she won't go in order in concepts... sometimes it can be unclear or confusing."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Super nice person, but asks a ridiculous ridiculous questions to students during class. She's actually a pretty good lecturer though and knows the material well. Name of the game is integration, by the end of the course you should have a whole story to tell about cells. Watch out for the first midterm... seemed easy but marking scheme is specific."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Midterms were extremely fair but super long. I did not finish either on time. Lectures are boring and all over the place, just stay home and listen to the podcast. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"At first I thought her lectures were really unclear and difficult to understand, but listen to the podcasts she posts of the lecture and they are MUCH easier to listen to and will be way more beneficial to you! I highly recommend that. Her exams are actually fair (but long), take what she says will be on the exam seriously and you will be fine."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Not recommended. Her exams are fair, but the marking scheme takes off points for the most ridiculous things ever. Expect a 14 page exam in 75 min.  Take someone else if you can. Textbook used for the course is horrible as well, and doesn't cover the material. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Wow this is weird cause I actually like her and I'm no stranger to teacher bashing. I found her lectures tedious at first because she aksed so many questions but then I realized she's just trying to make us think critically and at least for me its working. Her midterms are long but if you know you're stuff and study her lectures you should be fine
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,SHE IS DIFFICULT
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Makes you miss Houseman's bio BY A LOT. Even if you try hard, you'll still find it difficult. Very unclear to the point as she jumps from topic A to topic C then back to topic A. Midterms do not reflect what was learned in class at all. She twists questions from the material to make them very difficult. Lectures are very dry. Just awful. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,she is nice lady buy somehow she has power to turn easy material to supper confusing. one of the worst prof in uottawa. her lectures are super boring u have to try hard to get the point out of her non relevant  speech. 
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Lectures are incredibly boring, not stimulating at all. A lot of what she says is also wrong. Tests would be fair, but her marking scheme includes answers that are not relevant to the question that was asked, and is also very specific. Overall a terrible professor. Thought Houseman was bad, but after taking a course with her, I really do miss him."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Professor Turcotte is actually pretty funny. She explains the material well, goes through it thoroughly and always answers questions. Her lectures aren't bad. HOWEVER, her midtermsfinal hardly reflect what you've learned in class. She's the toughest grader I've ever known and writing her tests feels like a war. Avoid if you want to save your GPA. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"The absolute worse professor. Avoid at all cost. Professors like her are the ones you never forget. I will always remember Dr. Petit-Turcotte and not for good reasons. Her exams are tough, final is cumulative + labs (not hard). I would suggest she sticks to working in labs and not teach. If you can avoid her, listen, avoid her at all costs. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"This was a terrible class, I would not recommend the class. She is pretty good at giving lectures, but her exams are way too long and the questions are hard. She tries to prepare you for the questions on the exam, but there is so much information and it is too long. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,Great class. She loves what she teaches so makes it super interesting with lots of examples.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"She's actually not a bad professor. Yes you will need to work hard to get a decent grade, but she definitely does her part in trying to get you there, she gives good examples, and grades fairly. Her answers to questions can however be cryptic."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"I have no idea why so many complain, the class is tough but there's barely any material to it, they just expect you to understand rather than memorize.. The prof is extremely nice though and very generous with recorrections. Makes up for the bell curve by a landslide. The final was a bit long but there were no difficult questions whatsoever."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,Excellent prof! Very interesting and helpful. Midterms weren't so hard but final was very difficult.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"Crazy midterm, I'm worried for the final. Overall she's not a bad prof, she explains the concepts well and uses funny analogies to help students understand better. She seems nice and all but the difficulty of her midterm is making me think that she wants to see half of her students fail. I mean come on, 58% class average and no bell curve? Wow."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"Not stimulating at all, hard material that he doesn't make any effort to make our understand easier. If you have her, good luck. If you have the chance to switch out of her class for any other prof on the face of the earth, take it."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"Although an great professor, does not test anywhere near fairly. Coming from  a guy with a 9.8 GPA (10 in all courses but 8 in bio1540). Yes she expects the proper term (and that is expected) but the material covered in the course does not properly represent the material on the exams. should post previous exams so we know at least what to expect."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"good prof! Seems intense but she really is a great person! If you have questions ask her she is more than happy to answer. Exams are very hard because you have no idea what to expect and haven't seen some of the things. However, she is a lot more interesting than the first prof! I would love to take more classes with her but I'm afraid of failing!!"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"She is the worst prof I've taken. Her explanations are horrible, her exams are very long and she doesn't accept the use of synonyms. You have to learn by yourself, and even when you spend forever studying the questions are vague and not on the important  materiel covered. She will ask something completely random out of like 9 powerpoints. Avoid her"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"This teacher is evil, it almost seems she likes to see students fail, the midterms were extremely hard and the final was made for phd students. DO NOT! take this class with her."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,Ridiculous prof and ridiculous Final. Completely unfaire and MADE to make you fail. Many students left either crying after the 3 hours or within the first 5 mins. CHANGE COURSES IF YOU HAVE HER!
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"A lot of her questions in the exams are stuff that aren't on the textbook or even being though. She doesn't explain that well and you always have to get what will be important for the exams, when you will spent around 12 hours and more to studying it for it. Don't take BIO1540/BIO1140 if it though by her. Good luck if you need it."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"Explains decently in class, but marks her midterms way too harshly. Her expectations before and after the exams aren't clear at all, her way or the highway, makes us guess all the time. Supposed to be an easy class, but she makes it way too hard for nothing. I don't recommend her at all."
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,Tests are way too long and she teaches a lot of stuff that aren't on the midterms....do not pick this teacher
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,Worst professor ever. Her exams are like if I want to become a doctor when it's not my plan. Taking another bio class to raise my gap up for nursing. Evoid taking the class with her.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,bad explanations and bad marking scheme. avoid her if you can.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1540,"She explains pretty well the concepts, she really breaks it down so you understand the basics. However, she is not fair during the marking of the exams, as the material explained in class isn't enough when explaining short answer questions on exams. She expects us to understand a vague question saying we should be able to assume what to answer"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1544,"Her final exam will leave you with nightmares. Otherwise a great prof, but that exam was ruthless"
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO3153,"Really nice lady, but an awful professor.  Her lectures are very dry and boring. She also seems to convert the material in a confusion fashion. She has a very strict marking scheme and doesn't seem to budge on anything. 1 midterm that seemed tough as well. Have to put in a lot of time to do well "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO3153,- Super hard marker - Not very helpful in explaining details - Learned everything from the textbook  - Dry content  - Not worth taking this course if you don't have to 
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO3153,"Her midterm was absolutely inproportionate to the content covered to that point, and the fact that it was worth 40% of our grade... with such an outrageous marking scheme. Previous year classes had 2 20% midterms which were actually harder but had a more lenient marking scheme. She thinks as if adding 1 mark to compensate for this is a big deal. "
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO3305,Avoid this class if it is being taught by her. She cannot explain the material and you lose points for using colloquial words when explaining concepts on the test. Not very helpful when you ask her questions.
University of Ottawa,Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIOB,"She doesn't explain to well, Recommend to read the text book and study in group to pass."
