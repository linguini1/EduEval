Carleton University: Ariel Fuenzalida, SOCI3055
Negative Summary:
* Assigns an insane amount of reading that is never tested on or discussed in class
* Tells you exactly what you need to have read for the exams, making the rest of your reading completely useless(which is annoying after you've read it all)

Positive Summary:
* You will get a good mark if you put in the work
* This class was definitely not boring and was easy on marks as 30% is simply for participating in weekly discussion
* The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor
* Final paper is a joke 12-14 pages..
* Amazing professor, studies in addictions was my favourite class and he was the one of the best prof's I had.

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms.

Positive Summary:
* I took the course as an online offering in 2021
* She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab
* The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2006
Negative Summary:
* Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr
* Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews)
* She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to

Positive Summary:
* Dr
* Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice
* Learning C isn't easy for most, and she does make the effort to ensure people mostly understand the concepts
* Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well
* She will try her best to understand your question and help you visualize the problem

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, ECOR1606
Negative Summary:
* I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material
* Assigments are hard a bit .Final exam was extremly hard
* She is not that bad with teaching but she is very very very tough with marking and creating questions for tests and finals
* She is rude and makes you not want to ask her anything ever again.

Positive Summary:
* She genuinely wants her students to do well
* The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track
* Complete a chapter every 1-2 weeks if you like keeping up with lectures
* Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor).

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2002
Negative Summary:
* she is rude, and show no-patience when u asking question
* Only in her office during office hours, a total of two hours that never fit my schedule
* I was just reading the other comments about her, and I'm not alone
* The most useless, boring and atrociously mean person

Positive Summary:
* She is too fast and she is strict in marking
* Some of the stuff at the end (like Linked List and everything it led up to), I found helpful for the classes, although if they are still selling the course notes, than I'd suggest buying those and reading them on your own time which beat attending lectures
* Even in her office, when I found the free time, she was never any help
* She is ok teacher but maybe not a nice person

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* This Professor does an awful job teaching online
* Her lectures are very confusing considering that they are all pre-recorded videos from pervious years
* I've had her as a prof for 4 diff courses, & my experience keeps getting worse and worse
* A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq
