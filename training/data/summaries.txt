Carleton University: Ariel Fuenzalida, SOCI3055
Negative Summary:
* If you don't try and keep up you will obviously do bad.
* Assigns an insane amount of reading that is never tested on or discussed in class.
* Tells you exactly what you need to have read for the exams, making the rest of your reading completely useless(which is annoying after you've read it all).
* I found his lectures very boring and impossible to follow, couldn't listen for more than an hour.

Positive Summary:
* You will get a good mark if you put in the work.
* The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor.
* He truly wants his students to learn and grow.
* He knows what he is talking about, but the the amount of readings in this course are ridiculous, and I am quite familiar with heavy-reading courses.

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms.

Positive Summary:
* I took the course as an online offering in 2021.
* She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab.
* The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project.

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2006
Negative Summary:
* Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews).
* She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to.
* The material can be confusing, but the practice exams they give out are really helpful.

Positive Summary:
* Dr. Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice.
* Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr. Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well.
* Most of the poor reviews are from salty first years.
* She will try her best to understand your question and help you visualize the problem.
