Carleton University: Ariel Fuenzalida, SOCI3055
Negative Summary:
* If you don't try and keep up you will obviously do bad.
* Assigns an insane amount of reading that is never tested on or discussed in class.
* Tells you exactly what you need to have read for the exams, making the rest of your reading completely useless(which is annoying after you've read it all).
* I found his lectures very boring and impossible to follow, couldn't listen for more than an hour.

Positive Summary:
* You will get a good mark if you put in the work.
* The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor.
* He truly wants his students to learn and grow.
* He knows what he is talking about, but the the amount of readings in this course are ridiculous, and I am quite familiar with heavy-reading courses.

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms.

Positive Summary:
* I took the course as an online offering in 2021.
* She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab.
* The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project.

Carleton University: Cristina Ruiz Martin, SYSC2006
Negative Summary:
* Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews).
* She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to.
* The material can be confusing, but the practice exams they give out are really helpful.

Positive Summary:
* Dr. Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice.
* Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr. Martin tries to make the best of it by teaching well.
* Most of the poor reviews are from salty first years.
* She will try her best to understand your question and help you visualize the problem.

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, ECOR1606
Negative Summary:
* I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material.
* Very tough I used to fall asleep every single lecture.
* ECOR 1606 is a easy but boring course that is slow for 5/6 of the course then picks up at the end.
* She makes the assignments very hard, but the written and the lab  midterms were fair.

Positive Summary:
* She genuinely wants her students to do well.
* The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track.
* Complete a chapter every 1-2 weeks if you like keeping up with lectures.
* Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor).

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2002
Negative Summary:
* There is only one worst prof than her in the systems department, and that is John Bryant!
* she is rude, and show no-patience when u asking question .
* I asked her about an assignment I had a small problem with, she told she can't help me, and to debug it!
* The most useless, boring and atrociously mean person.

Positive Summary:
* She is too fast and she is strict in marking.
* Some of the stuff at the end (like Linked List and everything it led up to), I found helpful for the classes, although if they are still selling the course notes, than I'd suggest buying those and reading them on your own time which beat attending lectures.
* Not the greatest prof, but could be worse.
* Had her for summer session of ECOR 1606 and I didn't like her much because I felt she taught for those who already had a programming background.

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2004
Negative Summary:
* This Professor does an awful job teaching online.
* I've had her as a prof for 4 diff courses, & my experience keeps getting worse and worse.
* A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq.
* In general, she is a really bad instructor.

Positive Summary:
* There are SO many opportunities for bonus marks it's not even funny.
* Her brightspace page is also organized really well with plenty examples and videos of her walking through solutions.
* Uses online references mostly instead of her own explanation for the course material.
* She was a fairly easy prof, and unlike ppl below I found her pretty helpful when I went to her office hours (once!)

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC2006
Negative Summary:
* The lectures were good even though a bit boring at times.

Positive Summary:
* Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there.
* She very clearly explains everything you need to know at a pace that makes it easy to learn, and is easily accessible outside of class if you need help If I were you, I'd avoid taking classes with Lynn Marshall.
* Her lectures are extremely well organized and she goes through many examples to further understanding.
* She provides plenty of material, practice and homework on her culearn (I don' think any other prof puts as much effort as her into her culearn).

Carleton University: Lynn Marshall, SYSC3303
Negative Summary:
* That said, she has some pretty annoying teaching problems: she marks by removing marks whenever you do something wrong, which is a problem because she asks vague questions with specific answers in mind.
* She also makes you memorize arbitrary things (e.g.
* Not a nice lady... has an intimidating presence.
* Likes to give long and hard midterms and even harder finals.
* Not very helpful when you speak to her either - will make you wish you didn't ask.
