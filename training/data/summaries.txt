Carleton University: Ariel Fuenzalida, SOCI3055
Negative Summary:

* This class was definitely not boring and was easy on marks as 30% is simply for participating in weekly discussion.
* The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor.

Positive Summary:
* Dr. Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice.

* She will try her best to understand your question and help you visualize the problem

University Of Toronto: Michael Khan, RSM100
Negative Summary:
* Course is doable (and aceable) if you attend lectures and write down all key case studies.
* But his tests are very heavily based on memorization and not having knowledge on the course.
* I went into the exam with a 4.0 and came out with a 3.0 which was insane considering the content isn't difficult.

* If you put in a solid effort, you'll do well.
* Talks a lot about himself which no one really cares about.
* Very out-of-the-box most of the times, although lectures can be monotonous sometimes due to the dry course subject matter.

Negative Summary:
* Midterm was definitely hard, but I knew that going in the course because I did so so in her BIO220 section.

Positive Summary:
* She is so passionate about what she researches and you can really see it in her lectures.

University Of Toronto: Sian Patterson, BCH210
Negative Summary:
* Absolutely terrible course... You need to take notes of EVERY little thing she mentions bc its testable.

* Lecture slides were horrible and disorganized, the most important things that even showed up on the final were not on the slides, but only briefly mentioned.
* The workload may be a bit heavier than other courses but I learned a lot from her class.

Positive Summary:
* She is incredibly unapproachable and uncaring.
* For the students that gave her a good rating.
* Dr. Patterson is one of the most caring professors I've had so far at U of T. I find that students rate professors based on how well they were able to handle a course, not how well a professor taught them.

* Although a lot of reading is required, but he will give you the questions before the exams to prepare, so it's pretty fair.
* That being said, expect A LOT of work and reading in this course.
* Last reviewer is clearly a top student who understands how to read a syllabus.
* He is very clear and is quick to answer questions.

University of Ottawa: Iain McKenna, PHI1103

* He didn't post the rubric for the final exam until 2 days before it was due, leaving many students confused and unsure of his expectations.

* Almost never at his office hrs (held an O.H.
* while he was out on a run) and would reply to emails a week later.
* His midterm had so many questions on it that were not covered.
* His class is not structured - it's just him going on long rants and tangents (2+ hours sometimes) that aren't at all useful to learning the course material.

University of Ottawa: Iain McKenna, PHI2398
Negative Summary:
* People who complain about their marks are missing the point of courses like his

University of Ottawa: Luc Poitras, BCH2333

Positive Summary:
* I would rather take another course instead of taking Dr. Luc as my prof.
* I think my time is more precious than his.

* However, the homework and partial labs seem easy at first sight but the TAs do not mess around.

University of Ottawa: Luc Poitras, BCH3120
Negative Summary:
* Exams were mostly application, and very hard; rubrics were SO specific (must hit key words!)
* It is quite unfair to blame him for how much material is in this class.
* Im so sorry but he is the worst professor I have ever met in my life.
* There are quite a lot of molecule names and reactions to memorize but it's not as bad as the people below me make it.

Positive Summary:
* Content was VERY interesting and slideshows were pretty organized.
* The material is not difficult, but with no learning objectives, you're left trying to figure out what he may or not ask as there is a lot of information.
* How do you ignore prof Najwa Haddad every week when she says to you "Hi have an amazing day"!.
* Honestly, probably the fairest exams I've written in any of my classes and for this alone, you can probably guarantee yourself at least an A- if you study straight from the slides.

University of Ottawa: Luc Poitras, BCH3170
Negative Summary:
* Without doubt one of the worst profs i have had during my undergraduate program.
* He blames the problems on course and claims metabolism is hard.

Positive Summary:
* He basically reads off the slides, does not explain anything so going to lectures does not make any differences.
* You will have to self teach a lot but he is very helpful in office hours.
* Everything you need are in his lecture notes.
* Dr. Poitras is very straightforward when it comes to midterms and finals; everything you need to know is on his slides.

* the final exam is really difficult so maybe rewatch all the lectures to be prepared.
* His lectures are unappealing and all over the place.
* he says things in the beginning of the course that might make you think he is but he comes off as passive aggressive sometimes as if he's being forced to teach.
* He's the worst prof I've encountered in all of uni.

Positive Summary:
* The lab itself was manageable but you are MAINLY interacting with TAs not Dr. Poitras.
* For the exams, rewatch the lectures and when he says "I do this question every year" trust him and review the question.
* Refuse to correct the evaluations if there are errors.
* Does not post marks until the very end, which means you have no idea how you are doing in the class.

University of Ottawa: Luc Poitras, BCH3756

* Doesn't answer questions and is very rude with students.
* The class was too time consuming 6 weekly hour labs Weekly homework and prelabs 5 reports In-lab presentation every other week Midterm+final.

Positive Summary:
* If this lab is not mandatory for you avoid it at all cost.

University of Ottawa: Michael Mulvey, ADM2320
Negative Summary:
* He cares about students and is very passionate about marketing.

Positive Summary:
* Professor Mulvey is definitely the best marketing prof at Telfer.

* He shows a lot of ad clips/video clips to convey the subject matter (very interesting).
* I would recommend him to anyone interested in Marketing.

University of Ottawa: Michael Mulvey, ADM3321
Negative Summary:
* This poor excuse of a prof doesn't even hand back the grades.
* Unless this class is mandatory to you, I would not recommend taking this course as an elective since it demands a lot of your time due to heavy workload.
* While you do need to (seriously) study for his exams and do your readings, it is all worth it in the end.
* He is so passionate about consumer behaviour that it makes you want to pursue it as well

Positive Summary:
* He talks a lot about himself, (which is fine), but it can get kind of weird and excessive.
* Even in class, he doesn't actually teach, just talks about his life really.
* Gives good insight on the group project too if you ask him directly.
* Prof Mulvey is amazing during the pandemic, he's easily best streamer I had since the start of online class.

University of Ottawa: Paula Sauveur, GNG4170
Negative Summary:
* We had a few study sessions at her house.
* She is the worst professor the University of Ottawa has ever hired.
* Worst professor I've ever had, and likely the worst professor at uOttawa.
* The notes/slide shows are a complete mess and seem random, she will put french paragraphs in notes (for the english section classes).

Positive Summary:
* Sadly there's no way out of taking her class for most students in eng.
* We only saw her 5 times during the semester, the rest were pre-recorded lectures that were over a year old, and one of those 5 times she delivered the lecture on her phone while out shopping in a store.
* Her course is not hard but is a considerably hostile environment in which she tries to strip students of as many marks as possible.
* Course material is very light though, don't buy the textbook: everything is online.

University of Ottawa: Paula Sauveur, GNG4570
Negative Summary:
* She is the worst professor in the northern hemisphere.
* Doesn't know how to translate her french notes to her english ones, leaving multiple mistakes behind.
* Absolutely disgusting display of teaching.
* I mean the rating (1.2) speaks for itself, i don't know why she is even a university professor

Positive Summary:
* Refuses to teach, refuses to mark, refuses to answer student emails.
* I'd like to write a fair review of Professor Sauveur that outlines the pros and cons of her marking strategy.
* I promise you you wont even know what shes talking about for that entire lecture.
* However, to be fair , shed be a strong 2/5 as a monkey, so its not entirely all bad.

University of Ottawa: Sam Alvaro, SOC
Negative Summary:

Positive Summary:
* Talks about research without referencing anything.
* His exams are all online which is good but they aren't about your knowledge but how well you can find VERY specific details in lectures/textbook.
* Condensing to points that differ from his.
* if you're reading this i want to say that i loved social deviance and that i really wouldn't have gotten up at 8:30 monday mornings to go to any other class.

University of Ottawa: Sam Alvaro, SOC1105
Negative Summary:
* He is not funny and people need to stop pretending he is.
* Ridiculously condescending, picks on students, and embarrasses them in class when they ask questions (which is really unfortunate for first-years who are adapting).
* I am in 2nd year and found the readings to be difficult, not 1st year material.

Positive Summary:
* This prof only uses Brightspace to evaluate students, including ALL of the exams.
* The material is sometimes hard to understand so make sure you buy the book.
* Lots of reading for this class but the lectures are just phenomenal.
* He teaches real-world issues in such a comprehensive way, you just HAVE to take a class with him.

University of Ottawa: Tanvir Quadir, ADM2304
Negative Summary:
* Explains the topic very well for a course with hard content

Positive Summary:
* Professor Quadir consistently goes the extra mile for students in his great preparation of materials and examples.
* His assignment basically give you answers meaning they should be easy.
* Very caring professor which will make recordings of the in-person lectures for students to review.
* Midterm and final exam are not hard if you listen to his review session carefully.

University of Ottawa: Tanvir Quadir, HSS2381
Negative Summary:
* Not a single negative thing to say about this dude.
* Hate math and I enjoyed this stats class.
* The lectures were a little boring, I always had to put them on 2x speed.
* This guy was hands down my favourite professor during the semester

Positive Summary:
* Go to class/watch the lectures, do the homework, and textbook learning checks, they cover exactly what you need to know.
* Super helpful prof, many evaluations and resources so you can practice.
* I didn't go to class, just read the textbook, practiced the exercices, and watched the recordings he posts if I felt I needed clarification.
* He cares about his students deeply and wants them to succeed.

University of Ottawa: Victor Emerson, HSS2381
Negative Summary:
* go to class with an open mind, don't be afraid to ask the same question 100 times, he'll give 100 different examples.

Positive Summary:
* such a funny guy.. there's no need to take notes.
* he's very encouraging to ask questions and he answers them wonderfully.
* He has lots of experience with research, so lots of great examples.
* Conveys the subject matter really well, and takes the time to make sure you understand what is being described

University of Ottawa: Vida Dujmovic, ITI1120
Negative Summary:
* I learned a ton of concepts in a short amount of time due to her amazing lectures and difficult assignments.
* Vida is not a hard prof at all; it's the subject matter that is hard.
* The reason her tests can be difficult is because you need to have an understanding of EXACTLY what the code is doing in order to get the answer... Too strict and the course is hard, midterm questions are very tricky.
* this course can be hard if you do not have previous programming experience.

Positive Summary:
* Highly recommend taking ITI1120 with Prof. Vida.
* Very great Prof, ITI 1120 is super easy and they gave tons of resouces to help students succeed.
* She's really nice and easy to follow during lectures, however there's a massive disparity in difficulty between the content she covers during class and the things you have to do for her assignments.
* You can tell she cares about having her students understand the material and develop good coding skills.

University of Ottawa: Wolfgang Koerner, POL2107
Negative Summary:
* He basically marks arbitrarily and is hard to come by during his office hours.
* Do you like taking massive amounts of notes through hard to follow lectures, just to get handed a midterm with 6 poorly designed questions that can be answered in 2 sentences.
* His lectures were a bit dry, but he always kept them on the short side.
* The way he explains the subject is so efficient when you're trying to remember all the content.

Positive Summary:
* Im surprised by the amount of positive feedback.
* The assignments are straightforward and relatively easy but you should probably start them a week or two in advance.
* Also confused by the amazing ratings on here.
* minimum work load, easy grader, and he gives you the exam questions before the test... what more do you want.

University of Ottawa: Wolfgang Koerner, POL2108
Negative Summary:

Positive Summary:
* A lot of people skip his lectures - don't.
* Koerner is very accommodating and extremely nice.
* I thought this class was going to be super easy and i wasn't going to learn much.... but my god, having the questions and researching the answers has taught me more about pol thought then any prof ever before.
* You get the answers and you get the marks.

University of Ottawa: Wolfgang Koerner, POL2207
Negative Summary:
* Knows the course is boring as hell and doesn't try to disguise that fact

Positive Summary:
* Best prof I've had so chill, easy going, and very informative.
* Classes are always short which is amazing and he is always available to talk.
* He knows his stuff and tries to make the best out of a lot of heavy material.
* He realises the bore that is POL2207 and lets you know what's important, and what you don't need to know..

University of Ottawa: Wolfgang Koerner, POL3102
Negative Summary:
* His lectures may be a little dry, but if you read the texts in advance you follow pretty well.
* Koerner's class can seem confusing just about all the time.
* Even though political thought can be dry, he tries to give you the basics.
* Wolfgang is a cool person teaching a boring topic

Positive Summary:
* Take Koerner's classes every opportunity you have.
* He is one of the nicest prof I ever had at UOttawa.
* Hilarious guy, if you pay attention to the lectures  and catch his humor you will have a great time in his class.
* Take notes on everything he says and regurgitate it on the exam and you're golden (I got an A and didn't buy the textbook).
