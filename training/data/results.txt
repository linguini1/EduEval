Amazing prof, shows true passion while teaching. This professor responds to emails in 2-3m most days no joke. Excellent Professor, his live lectures were all great. All of his lectures are fascinating and will go over things you missed if you ask. His lectures are really informative and have a great amount of depth. Honestly the best prof I have ever encountered. He is just a great guy, helped me with school and non-school related subjects. Really wants you to understand the material and gives you everything needed to do so. One of the most caring professors you will ever meet. He taught the course really well given the circumstances. Many students from non-computer majors come in and watch his lectures. Excellent Professor that puts genuine effort into his lectures. Very generous with midterm marking and wants everyone to do well. As long as you attend the lectures and take some time to understand the material Gohary is one of the best professors you can take.
Negative Feedback: 
If anyone says this professor is bad they are simply lying because they did not put the effort needed to pass the course. The midterm and exams are hard, but he truly does want every student to pass
Neutral Feedback: 
Prof. He gives you tough dad vibes where he acts tough in class but he really cares a lot about his students. Expectations for midterm/exam weren't too far fetched. I could see how passionate he was when he taught.

Explains everything about the course, you could probably understand it straight out of highschool. Do all the homeworks without procrastinating, and you'll do great. Gives great lectures and is always happy to help in office hours. which keeps you up to date throughout the semester. Exam was fair, test and labs were marked easily and there were bonus marks on the midterm. He will take the time to clarify in the lecture or during office hours and makes sure you understand. If you can do the few problems in the book, you will do great on his quizs or exams
Negative Feedback: 

Neutral Feedback: 
Looks for opportunities to help his students out, not just with their learning but also marks. when u ask a question, explains the answer instead of just saying it. His solutions to the problem sets had a couple simple mistakes like writing 3/7 instead of 3/8.

Professor: Lynn Marshall
ECOR1606: 
Postive Feedback: 
She genuinely wants her students to do well. Ecor1041-1042 She is a nice professor and has good structure in her lectures. The lecture is so-so, actually not that effective. Definitely recommend to practice and study on your own. She has the most monotone voice I have ever heard. The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track. If you attend ALL her classes, its an easy A+. If you took even one high school programming class, you should be good for ECOR 1606. and yeah she is a great swimmer, swimming coach and world record holder. Never available for consult outside of the class, even when you email her she just tells you to follow her office hours (first time I've ever experienced this with a professor).
Negative Feedback: 
I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material. Assigments are hard a bit .Final exam was extremly hard . She is rude and makes you not want to ask her anything ever again. She usually goes over the assignment the lecture after it's assigned
Neutral Feedback: 
She can be particular on how things are done and submitted, but is always super clear on what she expects beforehand. I used to fall asleep every single lecture. She explains things in a clear way, especially for the students who are complete noobs to coding. ECOR1606 Doesnt actually teach, just talks and types and doesnt get the class involved. You actually learn how to do stuff in the lab sessions. Given the content of this class the lectures are extremely boring, however Lynn is excellent at explaining the material. Do the Mock Midterms/Finals PASS sends out. Tough assignments, fair midterm and easy lab final. Hard to gain enough marks to pass before the final. Read the lecture notes and skip the lectures that don't help with the assignment.

She is too fast and she is strict in marking. Had her for summer session of ECOR 1606 and I didn't like her much because I felt she taught for those who already had a programming background.
Negative Feedback: 
she is rude, and show no-patience when u asking question . The most useless, boring and atrociously mean person

After adjusting to programming lingo and what not, I found her to be very...interesting, in terms of her lectures. Only in her office during office hours, a total of two hours that never fit my schedule. She is ok teacher but maybe not a nice person

Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there. She wants people to keep on failing and not passing her course

If I were you, I'd avoid taking classes with Lynn Marshall. I found the midterm and final to be moderately difficult, but overall fair. She provides plenty of material, practice and homework on her culearn (I don' think any other prof puts as much effort as her into her culearn).

SYSC3303: 
Postive Feedback: 
Gives great lectures and the notes are good. She is pretty helpful when you ask her questions.
Negative Feedback: 
That said, she has some pretty annoying teaching problems: she marks by removing marks whenever you do something wrong, which is a problem because she asks vague questions with specific answers in mind.
Neutral Feedback: 
That said DO NOT take 3303 with her in the summer, she expect you to do 12 weeks of spread out work in 6 weeks and still marks hard (no clear marking scheme). She also writes marathon exams and midterms like go into the exam and try to do as much as possible correctly not finish cause u wont.

SYSC2004:

There are SO many opportunities for bonus marks it's not even funny. Every bonus opportunity is also a meaningful example to engage with the course material in a practical way. Her brightspace page is also organized really well with plenty examples and videos of her walking through solutions.

This Professor does an awful job teaching online. Her lectures are very confusing considering that they are all pre-recorded videos from pervious years.

A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq. Lots of bonuses in the class (around an extra 7%) which will really help.

Professor: Cristina Ruiz Martin
SYSC2006: 
Postive Feedback: 
Learning C isn't easy for most, and she does make the effort to ensure people mostly understand the concepts. Martin is much better in person, although she has little control over the exams, she delivers course content in the most digestible manner possible. She takes an effort to answer questions and does a lot of examples/visual explanations, which is much needed for a programming class.
Negative Feedback: 
Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews)
Neutral Feedback: 
Dr. Ruiz Martin gets a bad rap for being associated with 1041/1042, but she is a lot better in person and is actually nice. Dr. Learning C is no easy task, the weight of the midterm and final are quite heavy, yet Dr. She has a bit of an accent, but it takes little time to get used to.

Professor: Mengchi Liu
COMP3005: 
Postive Feedback: 
I don't understand why many students are rating the professor low. He seems like he'd be a really nice person in real life because he gives extensions whenever we ask for them... This professor absolutely does not care about the class he is teaching at all. He is absolutely 0 at teaching, hopefully he is ok at research otherwise why Carleton hired him. Doesn't answer questions usefully in class or anywhere else - if you don't get something, you're on your own. Get ready to remember who won the Turing award. He reads off of slides that are usually filled with mistakes that he doesn't fix until after he notices or someone points it out during a lecture. The moment I looked at his slides and saw there were more than 60 pages, I gave up on actually attending lectures. Creates lectures the day of and are riddeled with many errors, fixing them in the middle of a lecture. Amazing how he can put together so many slides and have no absorb-able information. Don't bother going to lectures because you will learn absolutely nothing. Do yourself a favour and drop any courses you've got with him, right now. A prof interesting on researching, not good at teaching, spent me a lots time self studying....read the book plz, then u get A, if any questions, ask him, he is nice to answer Qs, even tell u more. Spend most of your time doing assignments and reviewing his lecture notes.
Negative Feedback: 
Extremely poorly worded assignments (cost me 10% of my final grade). Extremely disappointed in this professor and really regret taking this course with him. His lectures are a mess, he's hard to understand and is not at all helpful when asked for help. The material wasn't difficult but the exam was. There are no good things that can be said about Mengchi. This is the absolute worst prof I've ever had. His wording can be extremely confusing and even self-contradictory. i had Prof Mengchi for comp 3005 and hes absoultely the worst professor i have ever encountered. Tons of typos and terrible Engrish on his slides. The class itself is actually not bad, but the way he teaches it is brutal. Terrible slides with tons of syntax/grammar/spelling errors which he doesnt bother fixing. Agree with the other reviews, at least for COMP3005. Seriously, this guy is the most boring teacher I've ever had. Uses text files to present the material, explains them horribly. Reads straight from slides, badly maintained website, hard to follow in class, poor assignment timing... This guy is out right the worst prof i have had in my university career (6 years). He talks very quite and the lectures are boring
Neutral Feedback: 
Professor Liu is generous with giving extensions and his assignments are based on his notes. Assigns time consuming work and gives little amounts of time. All the info youll ever need is in his slides which i can appreciate. Assignments were incredibly long (especially the last 2) and were confusing. Single word answers to specific questions asked, barely responds to emails, the midterm was longer than an assignment and we had to wait to begin the midterm so he could "confirm our identity" over BBB (We could leave the call after this...(?)). take this course at Ottawa U or with another prof, or run away!!. I really would like to enjoy his lecture and learn something useful but unfortunately he just doesn't give me the chance. So disorganized and doesn't care for students. Monotone voice during lectures and hard to hear back for emails. I have not learned a single useful thing in this class. He always posts the assignments really late and gives us about a week to complete them. Exam was a joke, but don't like how he makes the assignments not clear on how much they are worth each. Do yourself a favour, DONT TAKE 3005 WITH HIM. He just reads his slides word for word without adding any value. Don't bother going to class, all he does is read the slides word-for-word. He crams the assignment due dates really close to each other for some reason. The professor... He feels like one of those professors that are there for the sake of having a grant and teaching only because he has to. This is one of the easier third year computer science classes. Reads his 80 slide ppt, which are riddled with errors. They're unclear hard to decipher and class attendance is low for that reason. Don't take what he's teaching unless it's both mandatory and he's the only one teaching it. His notes have incorrect code(queries) in them. Uses obsolete and buggy software for assignments. He is utterly useless in class and even more so if you go in and speak with him.

You will get a good mark if you put in the work. The content of the course is interesting and he is overall a very nice and helpful professor. Amazing professor, studies in addictions was my favourite class and he was the one of the best prof's I had. Genuinely cares about his students success. If you are ever struggling with anything, go see him in office hours, he is SO helpful, clear and supportive of your ideas and writing. The course material is interesting but for the most part everything is made far more complicated than needed
Negative Feedback: 
Assigns an insane amount of reading that is never tested on or discussed in class
Neutral Feedback: 
Final paper is a joke 12-14 pages... Where do I begin. Also, the prof who engages students by using videos. Most of the SOCI students complained about the 3-hour length and weren't very engaged to begin with. Tells you exactly what you need to have read for the exams, making the rest of your reading completely useless(which is annoying after you've read it all).

Professor: Paul Mkandawire
HUMR2202: 
Postive Feedback: 
Not because the material is important but because attendance is taken with paper and pencil. The material is interesting but the instructor can't teach it. Paul never answers emails, but is pretty understanding in-person and when grading.
Negative Feedback: 
Can't put into words how horrible this class was taught. I never say anything negative about profs but this guy was by far without a doubt the WORST professor I have ever had in my multiple years of school. I've attended 3 different schools and have never come across a professor that was so disorganized, not understanding, rude, and just plain and simple awful. He doesn't care, won't be at his office hours, won't talk to you outside of class and then gets mad at you for asking questions in class.
Neutral Feedback: 
Attendance is required for the class and the tutorials. I will not take another human rights couse again. This 2nd yr course is harder than all of my 4th yr courses. It is clear he has zero care for his students, is unaccessible and at times just rude. Your entire grade is based on 4 items with little to no criteria. Intelligent guy, but hes awful at explaining, answers to his quizzes dont make sense, doesnt reply to emails... I could go on. This prof does not seem to care for his students at all. if you can avoid taking his class, i beg you to do so. The course was only based on 4 marks, if you don't test well don't take this course. He rounds up, but tests on obscure/one-week topics.

Kotar is extremely professional and resourceful. Professor Kotar is one of the best professors i've had at Carleton. She gives good feedbacks and the lectures are interesting. Professor Kotar is the BEST professor at Carleton. Easy grader and very clear and concise with what she wants you to do and how you will be graded on it. Her lectures are very interesting and shes excited to teach. It's clear she loves teaching since she always has a smile on her face
Negative Feedback: 
She is not a really great prof.. she is not approachable and is not effective at conveying information

Dr. Her class catapulted me into choosing a Masters program with certainty. Her evaluation technique is different from other professors that i've had (which is really good). 4 video quizzes and 3 other assignments and a final in class exam and she drops your lowest grade.

Excellent teaching, he explains everything very clearly and answers everyone's questions. I really like the approach taken for teaching the class and he is very understanding. I'm not a physics-inclined student, but he makes it easy to understand the material and to have fun. Andrew was the most caring and attentive prof I had first year. Really great professor, very clear when explaining concepts, always tried to answer any questions we had. Absolutely the best prof I've ever had at U of T. His pre-class videos and super helpful, he's always willing to meet with students outside of class for further clarification on the material, and he explains concepts in an easy to understand way.
Negative Feedback: 

Neutral Feedback: 
Even if you think you do not like physics, take his course and you will change your mind. I really enjoyed the simple demos in class instead of simply dumping theory on us and saying "it works btw". He reviewed questions posted in every online quiz and went through some of them in class. Also, you really see how he tries to make an effort in helping his students. Would recommend the textbook for further examples and instruction, though not entirely necessary.

Professor: Katherine Daignault
STA302: 
Postive Feedback: 
Katherine was a fair instructor, organized, clear lectures & provided leniency with 2 no-questions asked extensions for students. She is easily offended, and questions are taken as criticism taking up a defensive tone as though we're attacking her character. Katherine is an okay lecturer, she explains the concepts clearly. She will torture you when you take the course, but she also will give you a huge curve when you done the course. The grading in this course are very inconsistent. The time commitment required to marginally do good in this course is extremely high. While prof tries to be nice, way too high requirements. Sooooooo many assignments and tests and projects. She packs the lectures with way too much content and gives way too much work. Great lectures and she provides neat notes. I really like her, I took her STA257 as well. The learninng experience with her in STA302 is amazing, she lay emphasis on how to use your knowledge and do analysis instead of just do the questions. And she responds emails and piazza detailed
Negative Feedback: 
Midterm exam was difficult, so prepare well. worst prof ever seen, donnnnnnnnnn't choose this ***. The most awful professor I have ever seen. Lectures are completely useless, she just reads off her slides. Quizzes are insanely hard and lectures do not help at all. Grading was late making impossible to drop course or CR/NCR before deadline. Worst prof in my entire undergrad, has no respect or empathy and gives 0 f about students and accommodating accessibilities. Horrible human being, I thought I knew what I was going into taking a course with her but holy I was so wrong. I had to create an account on this website just to express how bad of a prof she is. The questions are just completely unrelated to the stuff she covered in lectures and everything u reviewed is just useless.
Neutral Feedback: 
Prof. Assignments & multi-part final project were manageable. If STA302 is your requisite course, AVOID this professor. Please consider taking the course in winter or summer term with other professors. Unreasonable marks on projects (She did not even tell us what we should do clearly). At least 2 assessments each week, some of them have no takeaways but only to waste your time. Literally the most difficult course I ever took in UofT. Course is filled with thousands of ridiculous graded discussions and assignments. I actually learned a lot about data analysis through her 3-part assignments and I didn't think they were that hard, you just have to read the marking scheme carefully. Too many assignments that are packed close to each other. Usually never bother to leave reviews but this prof was absolutely horrendous. Honestly, the content shouldn't even be that difficult - she just makes it extremely hard to piece everything together so, in the end, your understanding is filled with gaps. Even if you grind at her class, there's a good chance you'll fail. Test and assignment marks are very random, answers write in two pages, she will not check the second page, just give 0 based on the first page. Takes every suggestion as personal attack. We have weekly quizzes, in class labs, discussions, midterm, video project, written exercises and final project with multiple parts. I don't get why she's making this course so work-heavy. The midterm for her online course was killer. Unlike any other midterm she or any stats prof has ever written. Ignores students' needs and accommodations. Slides are wordy and much of words are useless, hard exams, ambiguous problems on assignments and exams, just read slides during lecture, low midterm grades (42%) and the curve can be neglected, plus full of typos on everything.

STA257: 
Postive Feedback: 
This course really require a lot of efforts. Her lectures are pretty detailed and very helpful for quizzes and exams. I really enjoy learning new statistics knowledges in her class. On many occasions she'd repeat herself without realizing it. She teaches fairly decent but the logistics and outside of class aspect is what weight the most. leading to most of us having panic attacks on the way out. First of all this was not very mathematically rigorously taught, more like we had to develop the intuition and learn the material on our own as the lectures were just a carbon copy of the textbook. Lectures consisted of her reading off her slides which were primarily copy pasted from the textbook. Good job reading from slides without explanation. She really messed up this attracting course. The later section can easily get the answer from the former one and have 2 more days for preparing
Negative Feedback: 
She is a ppt reader, totally waste of time to attend her lecture. Always made mistakes in quizzes, quite rude to students. Taking this course is the worst experience in uni and I received the worst grade that I have ever got with no surprise. ( The participation requirement is a bit annoying, especially for people living in other time zone like me. There is heavy pre lecture prep and needless synchronous lectures with little value to add to the independent prep. I got an A, but she is the worst prof I have ever had. I knew im going to fail the minute i see the question. Choose Katherine if you want fail this course. The worst prof I have seen at UofT, or I should not say she is a prof or a teacher. I probably gonna fail STA257, she is rediculous. I dont know how she manages to copy and paste the textbook and do it wrong every week. Definitely the worst professor I've ever met in uoft. I haven't ever found statistics that hard. Even though her slides are not too bad, there are countless typos and she cannot even fix her mistakes during the lecture. Lecture is a waste of time and test questions are unfair.
Neutral Feedback: 
I understand every word in her question but I dont understand the question. I would say the quality of the pre-recorded videos is high. Just don't take this if STA257 is not mandatory. The pre-lecture videos are just reading slides and the lecture is mostly-repeating slides -- but in a faster way. If you do need to take STA257, I recommend you to take the summer section. She clearly put a lot of effort into the class and seemed to care a lot. Had such a traumatic experience in STA257, I really wish I had listened to what rate my professor and raddit posts said about her... The median for the test was 52. I hope you're not compelled to take her as I was. Tests are way harder than questions in lecture. I gave 1.0 because apparently RMP does not allow me to give 0 or below. I was actually looking forward to this course but Katherine absolutely ruined it. Why would someone teach stats if they're clearly not interested in the students' learning process?. Extremely difficult test, easy examples in class. Didn't allow mic access during office hours.. Overall lectures are kind of boring and not very engaging. Her quizzes always appear with some ambiguous options. I will repeat three times: avoid her, avoid her, avoid her!!!!!!!. Insensitive comments when responding to students. Refuses to listen to students needs and does not troubleshoot. Slide reader, lots of typos, cannot answer questions asked in class, unreasonable exams. I got A in all other second year course except for this one. I think she was helpful and has potential. The final exam is way harder than the materials we leaarnt throughout the term (and the past papers taht were given to us). It's like a final exam for graduate students. In the night section, she would often rush through content so that she could leave early (class went until 10). Even one on one I find that she is not confident in her explanations or isn't clear. WORD-BY-WORD COPYING... If we could just read the textbook, why would we still need you. She is unenthusiastic about teaching and does not prioritize students. The wording and question form were totally different. The last quiz did test on the most two difficult chapters of this course, but it's basically the same as questions on her slides, be prepared. Covered knowledge from third year and even fourth year statistics courses in a second year course. Exam was not representative of course material or preparation questions. Super hard final, you cant understand what the question is asking. My CGPA is currently 4.0 and I think it will change because of this course. She always gave vague answers and explanation in class and refuse to clear them. Also, she made tons of mistakes in simple calculations which is rarely seen in such a stats course. I've been there once and I swear I will never go again. she even made simple mistakes in simple calculus. She made the exact same questions for both sections while the tests were scheduled two days apart. During the test she refuses to clarify ambiguous questions.

Professor: Sian Patterson
BCH210: 
Postive Feedback: 
She is incredibly unapproachable and uncaring. I really hope someone else teaches the BCH210 class. As the person responsible for all our tests, yikes. As a lecturer and course coordinator, I've actually found that she's really nice and accessible in person. Patterson is a good lecturer I learned a lot about biochemistry. She needs help cause she really thought we were phd level students. Even if you know the materials inside out, she makes sure to pull the weirdest questions. The slides are not as detailed as lectures. Every word and every sentence on her slides are testable, so make sure you fully understand them. However, as long as you prepare well, it's very possible to get good marks on her tests. Professor Patterson is a very good lecturer and easy to follow, organized, and I actually really enjoyed the material. Patterson is a good lecturer; her slides are easy to understand and she explains concepts quite well. i think that dr patterson is able to explain the content well and i do leave the lectures with a pretty solid understanding of the material but testing is just not reflective of what is taught. sometimes better at explaining concepts in office hours. MC questions ask you which is most important for metabolism, you can provide an argument for all the answers, but the correct one is what she thinks it is. Metabolism in Motion: Engaging Biochemistry Students with Animation". Publishing paper like this does not make you a better professor, Patterson. I've got 4 textbooks, and I still can't do good in her class. For the students that gave her a good rating. She doesn't answer questions in any sort of useful or helpful way, and goes through lectures too quickly. You come into u of t fresh faced and optimistic. Professor Patterson is the best thing that has ever happened to me. Tests the most obscure details while never focuses on them in lectures. She is so kind, she shelters the blame for an average of 52%. Patterson does absolutely nothing to help you learn. I am sitting in her class rating her, I'd rather read the textbooks I bought but since I paid for tuition its better to sit here even I do nothing. Don't know which the important to remember. It is very quick explaining in the end of the course, I cannot follow very well. Prof Patterson has been an amazing professor throughout the term and made biochemistry actually quite fun. Patterson is tough, but her class is very fair. people come to university to get a good education not to get easy work. In order to get an A, focus more on the learning objectives and actually participate in tutorials. Her lectures were fine... The assignments are super long, and mostly unrelated to anything we learn about in class. It's quite surprising to see how high her rating is. I get that we, as university students, are responsible for learning the materials. It feels like I learn more from Google than her. That's about 10 hours for the whole summer semester. Lectures are short and not too detailed but the quizzes are soooo detailed. But i found that the material itself is actually very interesting. Her slides are organized and easy to follow. She was clear, concise and organized, and her test questions were extremely fair. Her section is the hardest, but most interesting and rewarding section of BCH210. Goes through material really fast, doesn't reply to emails. Amazing Prof. It was really fair if not easy in my opinion. She writes the kind of final you need two weeks to study for. Test was super fair and she made a lot of material seem like a breeze.
Negative Feedback: 
Absolutely terrible course... the content was doable and its biochem so obviously its tuff but she made it IMPOSSIBLE. I want to confront her and tell her she made my dislike myself over a STUPID COURSE. On tests, there are trick questions that require you to carefully read every word of the question because it is trying to lead you to the wrong answer. this course is not easy, but majority of us required it and had no choice. BCH with Patterson is the worst course I have ever taken. Assignment and her teaching sucks, course can be self taught. That being said, her tests can be BRUTAL. by far the worst professor and course I have been forced to endure during my time at uoft. Somehow finds a way to make mc tests excruciatingly difficult and hyperspecific on very peripheral information. The tests and quizzes are unnecessarily difficult. Content isn't that hard but the way the questions are worded results in poor grades. Studied a week for the midterms and the results were still horrible. Really the worst professor I've had at this school. Her aim is simple: YOU SHOULD ALL FAIL IN BIOCHEMISTRY, period. Awful term test with a 59% average INCLUDING 2 bonus marks. Coming to Con Hall at 10 am 3x a week is miserable enough. She makes every topic very confusing and cannot manage her time efficiently. Awful PowerPoints, not helpful at all, not well-organized and makes you confused. so so unfair that awful professors are allowed to continue teaching required courses for so many majors and get paid so much. Makes you feel bad for getting low quiz marks as if we all have a phd in biochemistry. Course turned into 3 tumbling research assignments and annoying weekly quizzes. She is hard marker and wants students to do poorly, she also has a bad attitude towards students when students approach for help. Aher exams are brutal and unfair with 0 curves, tries very hard to screw your mark in the course. Never ask any questions cuz she uses passive aggresive tone with a disgusted expression on her face. She only reads slides in class and gives brutal exams. Lectures were fine, just a bit boring and confusing. The poor TA had to teach us everything during a 2 hour weekly tutorial. when emailing her, she can be very rude and dismissive. Very hard to follow along in her lectures. Unspeakably poor delivery methods, shameless lack of awareness on her part. She's clearly reading off a script, making efficient, active-recall type notes impossible. Quizzes are terrible 15 minute 10 questions, lectures are pretty useless. She much more horrible than anything else except the COVID19. Whatever small detail she says in the lecture, guarantee you it will be on the quiz. The writing assignments were absolutely heavy and unpleasant. Her lectures seem simple but her test questions and assignments are insane. One of the worst professors I've had at UofT. Her quizzes are difficult, and contain material that was discussed for less than a minute during lectures. She isn't a bad prof but her tests are extremely difficult. Was scared to take a course with her because of the horrible reviews.
Neutral Feedback: 
The tests are the biggest flaw of this course. It tests you on insignificant details and the difficulty level does not reflect her teaching. You need to take notes of EVERY little thing she mentions bc its testable. Pay attention to the pics and the tiny words on the pics. The assgmt was a mark booster but u need to work for it. I hope she understands how detrimental this is for her students. Please Uoft, my mental health is already messed up and you decided to bring patterson to screw me up harder. I am sure the content was not that bad BUT MAN she hates us. Please run, if you cant, speed walk AWAY FROM THE PATTERSON. BCH210 would benefit from not focusing on the minutiae of lab techniques, any lab a student joins would cover procedure and we wont remember all the details without application in the lab. Not organized and does not go over order of slides. Please be ready to be railed harder than 1st year Chem. In retrospect, it was a decent class, albeit harder comparatively to other life science courses, which is why most people leave negative reviews. Midterms are the toughest part of this course. That being said... Not at all intuitive and the multiple choice had me debating different answers that could be argued to be true. Dr. However, BCH210 is an INCREDIBLY content heavy course and the tests are very difficult. tutorials are optional but extremely helpful. She is ok/good as a lecturer, at least better than some of my other profs. Her tests and quiz questions are just something else. I'm still screwed for the final lol but at least she makes me giggle sometimes. I get that university is a business but what professor wants to see her students fail. If I manage to pass this course, I promise I will start going to church. I didn't really enjoy her course, & having her as a prof made the course much worse than it already was. Expects us to have PHD level knowledge going into a test. This rapidly deteriorated over the course of the semester. HOWEVER, her tests are philosophy, or gambling, just not biochemistry. Class averages are very low and you have to work hard to get a decent grade in the course (75-80). If you can take this course with another professor I highly reccommend doing that. But you did it you got through the hardest part of university, or so you thought. She is very considerate when it comes to quizzes and other assessments. I aspire to be like her someday, in which I'll be able to give students a very hard time. the other ratings sum up how it feels to be in her class. The answers for her quizzes don't even match with her lectures. You work really hard, and you spend a lot of time on this, then you get a super low grade even she gives everyone two extra credits. Sian is one of the profs at U of T. She has top-of-the-class wording for her questions. It's almost like you are reading a manuscript from Shakespeare. CHANGE YOUR MAJOR if this course is mandatory. Quiz and test questions are unrelated to lecture content. It's not helpful when the midterm average is a 52%. If you have Patterson for BCH210, run away & hope you can take it w/ someone else. You leave each lecture feeling even more confused about the concepts. Not accessible, not caring, not considerate. No such luck but at least I'm finally done. Agree with the two people below who took this course in Summer 2022. Even though the other comments have poor opinions of her, I personally feel she has taught the course well. I asked her extend 3 days for each of my assignment. She needs doctor notes as well as documentation for the college registrar. Make sure you absorb every single word she says in lectures for quizzes, and I mean every. In one sentence, emphasize A and test B just to confuse you. Can't learn for quizzes with her lecture. One of the most uncaring and rude professors I have ever encountered; if you need any accomodation regarding assignments/quizzes whatsoever, expect nothing, regardless of your circumstance. Lectures are ridiculously condensed and convoluted and quizzes test things she says in a split second. Asks for the moon yet only gives you a page for details + images which means you'll be running out of space real fast. Dr. Don't interpretate things well and only read slides. Assignment grades were clearly told to be held to a specific grade. Couldn/t really excel with rng marking and the final. She never teaches anything relevant for exams making lectures useless to go to. Didn't understand why we had lecture AND weekend quizzes. Yes, she does seem to focus on tiny details in quizzes and BBQs, but fortunately, it's not worth that much. Patterson always sides w/ the TA's and will never acknowledge that they're sabotaging students grades. The workload may be a bit heavier than other courses but I learned a lot from her class. As a teacher at a tertiary level institution her demeaner is uncaring, uncompassionate, callous and inconsiderate. Petty, impossible over email and genuinely also a terrible prof who tests you on the most arbitrary minute details she mentions in lecture. While her teaching may not be the worst her overall lack of care for students' well-being is incredible. The grading in her class (by TAs or her) is so inconsistent. This course was challenging and I found it hard to learn the material with her lecture style. Her lectures are not helpful and she rushes through them. She talks as if everyone understands every single word she says and has seen the material before. Never seen a more universally disliked prof. Inconsiderate, rude, and quite frankly not at all good at teaching anything. really take a toll on your mental health (even if you do well). 3, 20-minute lectures and 1, 2 hr, slow-paced, ADHD styled tutorial per week. We only got 1hour lecture per week and was quizzed on everything and everydetail. There's no way she has a 2.5 because she doesn't even deserve a 1. The textbook is useless, 4 hours lectures per week normally are condensed to 1 hr per week. Her lectures don't match the testing and there's nothing but testing. Most random things could pop up on the exam. I found Prof. Patterson to be very unapproachable and even rude. She tests on things that were barely or never discussed in lectures. Extremely time-consuming and not good for your mental health. The assignments were tedious and time-consuming where we were expected to teach ourselves an entirely new concept instead of applying what we have been learning in lectures. Online, however, she became a different person. Her explanations outside of lectures are extremely vague, and she responds to questions in a very condescending manner. But as a professor, you are responsible for HELPING US LEARN, not screwing us over with insanely hard quizzes and assignments. There is a reason why everyone hates her. She literally tests you on small details that were mentioned just once in her lectures, so you basically have to write every single word she says. 10 harsh questions given only 15 minutes. If you politely ask her sth, she just blames on you. Someone politely posted if she could disclose the class average for her midterm (it was VERY low and hence wasn't said). Her online lecture's so fast-paced and mentions the tiniest details in such a short amount of time. Hardest course I've taken at UofT. Doesn't explain things well. Part 3 of this course can be a little bit overwhelming with all the pathways and reactions. She also takes a lot of questions during lecture (through an app). Dr. Patterson is TOUGH, but she genuinely cares about her students succeeding and understanding the material. You know when she says, revise these mechanisms, know those regulatory mechanisms.

Professor: Michael Khan
RSM100: 
Postive Feedback: 
Do the wiley plus questions as well -- those are great practice. The lectures are engaging and the prof is nice. Prof Mike does not do much himself except lecture. He made the course challenging when it really shouldn't have been. He sells you his own textbook and teaches only from his life. Hes a fraud who sells his own textbook to students. However, it's certainly important to listen to every word he said during the class, especially the guest lecture. Prof Khan is one of the best profs you will have in Rotman first year. Midterms and finals are easy and short if you study correctly. Everything in lectures are testable which makes it easy to study. ( He is kind and it is your first opportunity in Rotman Commerce to network with a valuable person. Study for the tests and try to get a good mark on the group project. The exam tested mostly on lecture content, rewatch the recordings, draw a mind map and write out possible quest if have time. Definitely not my favourite prof but I surely learned a lot from him. He made a really good effort to adjust to online learning. And he made lectures more interesting with his case studies. I got a 64% the first time and had to redo the course. Overall, a really nice and funny guy... likes talking about himself but he keeps lectures fun and engaging. Gives you a good overview of business also catches you up on current events. He marks his short answer very specifically so make sure you write word for word what he says in lectures. He's a pretty inconsiderate guy and will tell you to retake the course if you don't like your grade. Spends class time talking about himself/his own accomplishments. Khan is an enthusiastic professors and lectures are engaging. He's funny and tries to make lectures interesting. The wiley quiz answers are on quizlet, but for the midterm and final you need to memorize and be able to explain concepts. Professor Khan was much better than Oesch. He was engaging, provided valuable examples, and made it clear as to what was being tested. Professor Khan is a great lecturer and encourages class discussion. He is very kind to students especially if you go to his classes so he knows ur face. I just toke RSM100 and Khan is a great professor!. Great professor, don't understand how anyone could not like him. He is pretty arrogant and loves to talk about himself, though. He is not a  "level 5 leader", as he does not seem to take review criticism very well. He enjoys himself more than 90% of his students. Gosh...who will pay attention for almost full year course and remember everything from his talking. He is an amiable man who enjoys his own classes ore than the students do
Negative Feedback: 
But his tests are very heavily based on memorization and not having knowledge on the course. One question asked the guest lecturer's companies name which seemed pointless. No one can understand what he says He gives a very difficult midterm and final with (30-50%) avg range with no bell curve at all in order to lower the averages... Textbook heavy, remember the vocab and italic ones. You need to write the key words down, word for word, or else it's wrong. Michael Khan is the stereotypical business person. The readings are so time consuming and useless, and the lectures are so boring but you MUST TAKE GOOD NOTES!. I did rlly bad on midterm cuz note taking things that he wasnt gonna post later was hard. His lectures are boring, he is full of himself and  he does not really teach anything of substance. His lectures are mostly pointless (but he puts 50% of lecture stuffs on the final exam..) So basically, he forces his students to attend his boring lectures.
Neutral Feedback: 
Course is doable (and aceable) if you attend lectures and write down all key case studies. Make sure to read textbook as multiple choice is heavily tested on the textbook. He teaches well, and it is very lecture heavy. Do not believe the other reviews, I let them scare me going into first year. If you speak to Michael directly, you get to know him and find out he cares about his students. Participating in class does carry weight (the syllabus won't say this). Personally I found this class to be easy as long as you went to lectures and read the textbook. Everyone I know had their mark drop at least 10% after the final, so make sure you have a really good grade going into the final and be prepared to have it drop even if the final feels easy. Exams are literally a piece of cake if you study enough. Turned an easy, informing course into an unnecessary struggle simply to weed out students in year 1. He is pretty funny but tries to make the course unnecessarily hard. Final was worth 40% and they curved down a lot. Go to class and takes notes word for word and memorize them the night before the exam like your life depends on it. The entire class was curved down heavily and I pity those who have to go through Khan's ego infested course again. This is a required course for Y1st Rotman Commerce students. Pay attention to the picture in the power point. The guest and professor would drop hint on the test question so LISTEN CAREFULLY. obviously there's online office hours, but it's just not the same. Professor Khan provided with engaging lectures and lots of case studies but his whole "everything is testable" and giving vague instructions was not it. Class is either meant to be yearlong or have lesser work. Attend lectures, take notes "everything is testable". If really work hard in this class, youll easily get an A. For the final exam, I studied tons and knew every question. Got a 99% on it while others got low 70s. ASK FOR UPPER YEARS PROJECTS and DO ALL ORION QUESTIONS for multiple choice on exam. Write down everything he says in class and even classmates answers. Midterms/exams are based on orion/wiley multiple choice (DO ALL). guy basically bell curved the entire class down by 10% by putting degenerate questions on the exam. Terrible prof, rsm100 is pretty much a joke of a course. You will die with his short answer marking. On average everyone's grade falls by 10% after the exam because of the marking on the short problems. Never touches on textbook content in lectures, tests you on textbook content and specific lecture content. Introduction to Management class but i didnt learn a single thing about management in his class. He forced us to buy new textbook when I already got a used one. He tends to talk about his summer abroad program non-stop - probably in an attempt to recruit students for future summers. Despite such a boring course his lectures were really interesting. So passionate and makes this course so much FUN. Khan will be the nicest prof you are ever gonna get in UofT. Remember to go to his lectures. Textbook use is mandatory and attend lectures because final exam questions are purely based on class discussions. This Professor does not positively add to the course. He engages students throughout the lectures; however, you need to attend lectures in order to do well in the course. His teaching style is class discussion based and you have to listen keenly as whatever is discussed is testable (literally, he says it himself). he was clear, had light humour, and humble. If you're taking his class you have to read your textbook and do not skip class. Easily my least favourite professor in first year. He shushes students even if only two people are talking. He then talks about how he took his kids to a farm for their birthday. He'll tell you about his summer abroad program. Jst likes to hear himself talk, especially if it's picking apart a student's earnest question. The materials for final were so much including the freaking chapters and his lectures and so on. Tests be super hard and manz be failing in hurr. His efforts to make the class lively and entertaining often end in making the classes useless to the students as the material taught is negligible

15% of course mark is on participation with an unrealistic rubric so he will screw you over if you get on his bad side
Neutral Feedback: 
I don't understand what's the point of mandatory participation which takes 20% of the entire course. His style of teaching and his extensive and interactive lectures helped us learn more from his one course than anything else I have done in my fourth year. If you put in a solid effort, you'll do well. Alot of group assignments and class participation. This prof is one of those people you have to get to know.

I first took the class in the fall and had to drop it because I wasn't doing well. Does not teach HMB265 yet writes a very unreasonable exam for it. P is one of the most caring and enthusiastic professors at UofT. Her lectures were interesting, she focused on what was important, and made genetics for me one of my favourite courses. She was always available to answer my questions, and her explanations were clear. P is an excellent prof who really cares about her students. P is one of the most helpful profs at UofT
Negative Feedback: 
Students had to memorize random facts (not related to genetics) to pass the course, VERY disappointing

She is clear-cut, helpful, and always willing to do more for her students and hear them out. Dr P is overall pretty kind and knowledgeable and her tests are very fair and easy if you study. The pacing of her lectures is very inconsistent. I loved the topics that she exposed us to, her lectures were interesting and informative, and she answered my emails quickly.
Negative Feedback: 

Neutral Feedback: 
In HMB204 you can truly tell the professor enjoys the content and teaching it. This is due to the fact that she rambles a lot which complicates content further. The in-class question period runs on for too long. This is an unwelcoming intro to Human Biology. Despite having taught this course for many years, I genuinely believed she was a first time professor due to how inexperienced her teaching seems. Dr. Dr. The way she teach is just OMGi try to stay awake or understand or read over the lecture or anything you could think of.

HMB265: 
Postive Feedback: 
I know I myself and even some straight A friends have gotten our GPAs nuked by this course. She is knowledgeable, caring, and responds quickly to emails. I enjoyed her lectures and she gave just the right amount of information to understand the relevance of the topic and to solve problems related to the material. I wouldn't have taken courses with her if I didn't absolutely had too. She gives an amazing introduction, amazing background knowledge, but the material which she will test you on, she just skims through it. I enjoyed the lectures by Prof. P and she's always available to answer questions. Although the course has a pretty heavy workload, I enjoyed her lectures, her test was fair, and her instructions are clear. P puts alot of effort into the course, and she is always available to answer questions. P is one of the best profs that I have had so far. She's super caring as a person (from my interactions) and she means well. She was always very helpful and I thought her lectures were easy to follow. P is a very approachable professor who is always very helpful. She is very approachable and kind, and will help with any question you may have (genetics or not!). Her exams are very fair (unlike many other courses at UofT!). However I didn't think she was a good teacher.
Negative Feedback: 
Terse professor when dealing with student questions and extremely harsh grader, even asking all TAs to be especially tough with the assignment grading. I found her lecture style to be quite unhelpful and confusing.
Neutral Feedback: 
Dr. actual info tested is not the info focused on in class -- ie the problems involving math. prof often rushed problem-solving due to time management issues while lecturing. I asked to a request to regrade and instead she made me cry through an email. Prof. stay away from courses she's the admit. Because somehow people don't believe me when I say it. She's approachable and lectures very clearly. You can see that Dr. Prof. The concepts in this course are pretty simple and straight forwards but she keeps spending the first half of the lecture talking about unimportant details and background information. Dr. P's lectures were organized and the content was clearly presented. However, the 2nd part of the course is significantly harder than the 1st so don't be caught off guard. I've had her for 2 courses and she's always been helpful. Prof P bells the marks like hell so kinda bird. Had her for other courses last year too - she's approachable, but often confusing in lectures. A nice and approachable prof that cares about her students, but her lectures were extremely hard to follow. She also seemed somewhat unprepared resulting in lectures that did not flow. Dr. P. is also extremely approachable and really cares about her students. It doesn't seem that she prepares for her lectures beforehand. Dr. P is crystal clear if you really listen to her lectures (and not speak in class). It almost seems as if she doesnt know what shes talking about sometimes.

He brought a lot of real world experience to the classroom and he made the lectures interesting. He brings in guest speakers that are really cool as well.

He only uses slides for his lectures with bullet points. He takes attendance, either you attend online or in-person. He also has a way about him that just makes you want to pay attention to him. Professor Hong only uses lectures and guest speakers. What a privilege I had to sit down in his class and learn about the importance of life insurance and risk management. The two exams are not hard, just show up and take notes. Notes are given every class and are not posted so you must attend class to get the notes

Neutral Feedback: 
She is so passionate about what she researches and you can really see it in her lectures. Midterm and final averages were very low, and assignments dont help boost marks. Low midterm averages, low assignment average, lots of readings that you get quizzed on weekly. " Participation marks" should be based on participation... Expects your answers to state something not asked in the question. Class average for midterm was in 50s then cancelled office after we got grades back..

He is not funny and people need to stop pretending he is. He would say to the entire class why dont you just CALL Brightspace.

Does not give details on what themes etc to focus on while studying.. Tricky MC exams

She is the worst professor in the northern hemisphere. Also a genuinely bad person whose ego is so big she would have to buy 2 plane tickets to go anywhere. I mean the rating (1.2) speaks for itself, i don't know why she is even a university professor
Neutral Feedback: 
Doesn't know how to translate her french notes to her english ones, leaving multiple mistakes behind. Paula thought the following exchange was "academic fraud" and called out two of her students (by name) in front of all their peers. How does uOttawa still employ a professor who doesn't teach. I promise you you wont even know what shes talking about for that entire lecture. However, to be fair , shed be a strong 2/5 as a monkey, so its not entirely all bad.

GNG4170: 
Postive Feedback: 
she teaches the most useless class of your degree but makes it seem like the most important. Course material is very light though, don't buy the textbook: everything is online. Many people don't buy her book and pass her class. Inspiring, wants her students to succeed, clear expectations of her students, great feedback on assignments and exams. Also her book of laws is great and worth the 100$. Firstly, we HAVE to buy a $100 textbook which she literally copied from the Government of Ontario's documents available in public domain. Doesn't matter if you hand in the best work or literally a blank paper - you will get a straight 75. She focuses more on her narcissistic accomplishments than actually teaching the class. Youre literally better off learning the course yourself, because she actually confuses you by teaching. Puts students on the spot with questions in front of the whole class.
Negative Feedback: 
We had a few study sessions at her house. I am shocked how she can do literally no work and not be terminated 5 years ago. One of the worst, rudest prof that you can't skip in uOttawa. She is the worst professor the University of Ottawa has ever hired. Terrible grader, will refuse to talk to you over email, and has no issue with insulting you straight to your face. She strives to make student's lives miserable. She makes you buy her textbook which is useless since you can find everything online. Lectures were not organized well and she is very rude towards her student. When I first read the reviews, I didn't think that she'd be this bad but after taking this class with her, I now know why people hate her so much. Dont bother speaking because youre wrong, and I hope youre bilingual because her PowerPoints are.
Neutral Feedback: 
Sadly there's no way out of taking her class for most students in eng. I really appreciated how she opened home studies and options to FaceTime her for extra office hours. Refuses to answer emails, teach, or mark. Future engineering law students should boycott the class. Maybe low attendance will finally get the university to do something. She doesn't like being asked questions and has an attitude. Graded on a case study, a midterm, and a final (which is a quiz and a case study). If you have access to anything from past years she will copy paste, don't expect to see your midterm because she gatekeeps her content and treats her students like little thieves which is ironic since her textbook is highway robbery. I'm baffled that the school charges us money for this. Only graded on three things throughout the course. Everyone has said everything there is to say about her. Her course is not hard but is a considerably hostile environment in which she tries to strip students of as many marks as possible. She is so bad she had to fake her OWN rmp rating last year. She'll tell you that you absolutely HAVE to buy her book multiple times, this is a lie. Paula gives little to no feedback for the exams and assignments. Refuses to be contacted directly by students. She is extremely arrogant and her lectures are nonsensical. In my opinion Paula Sauveur is not a good teacher at all, she doesn't seem to care about her students and speaks way too fast in class to be able to learn well. I don't recommend taking her course at all if it is a course you are not obligated to take. I've had my fair share of terrible professors but most of them just suck at teaching. Made students teach themselves the last lecture only a few days before the final. I can't believe they're still letting her teach this summer. I reluctantly enrolled in this course only because my schedule opened up for another course. By far the must frustrating class I have taken. The notes/slide shows are a complete mess and seem random, she will put french paragraphs in notes (for the english section classes). She forces everyone to spend around $100 on the textbook she wrote but justifies it by saying she barely earns anything off it. She is very condescending towards students and talks down to those who ask questions.

ECO1102B:

Is very opinionated and brings up unrelated things during lectures. His slide notes are great and you don't need to use the textbook. The Aplia is a perfect way to gain added marks. He is always available to  answer questions and respond to emails quickly.
Negative Feedback: 
I'm not saying they were just hard, of course i've learned stuff that was much harder than economics but he made it way harder and boring
Neutral Feedback: 
He was never available outside of class and whenever you would go to him or email him, he would give you a short aggressive answer. Wasn't helpful when I reached out for help. Don't give any extra assignments to help raise your grade and overall doesn't seem to care about his students. The prof is accessible outside of class and is quite intimidating.

ECO1102: 
Postive Feedback: 
He doesn't help his students and doesn't convey material in a logical and simplified form. probably my heaviest class but one of my better marks. ECO1104 and ECO112 are both relatively straightforward courses. Makes his expectations very clear, and all assignments/exams are fair and manageable if you keep up with the course material. Surprised if anyone got a good mark on them. I have another class with him and am genuinely looking forward to it. Midterms were easy though, all multiple choice. He refuses to post his lecture notes and goes through the slides so quickly. The exam takes a lot of application so you need to really understand. If you aren't a math person get ready to WORK girl. Don't bother going to class, everything is on bright space and in the textbook. Good lectures, but not an easy grade, you have to work for it and practise. Lectures are dry but useful if you want a good grade in the class. If you just show up and listen rather than watching a movie on your laptop, youll be fine. People are probably bias because they want this class to be easy A. His notes are thorough and lectures very intense and informative. Aplia assignments were fine and were free marks. I had him for 1102, he's very well spoken and will respond to emails. One class might be good, the next your board and waiting for it to end. The concepts aren't easy but if you attend lectures and follow his notes you can do well. He is very fair and let's you know what is important to study. Very approachable during office hours and gave good advice and answers to all my questions. Lenjosek's most redeeming quality is his clarity and his lecture notes. love his lecture notes when I overselpt the morning classes.
Negative Feedback: 
he's mean, it's like he prides himself in making life very difficult for students. His lectures are very boring and unclear. Midterms are basically designed to make you fail. The workload wasn't crazy but the mid-terms were awful. the worst and rudest professor at uOttawa. Tests are difficult, lectures are boring and his attitude is horrendous. Seems like his life is unhappy and he takes it out on his students. He comes off as rude sometimes and when asked a question he sometimes doesnt answer. The practice midterms are so useless - in summary: just dont take him.
Neutral Feedback: 
I reached out for help multiple times and was told there was nothing he could do to help me. I would not recommend taking Prof Lenjosek. watch the lectures but use the textbook to copy notes so you can screenshot images/graphs. Frankly I'm not sure why the reviews are so mixed. You don't need to attend lectures (although they are helpful) just read the textbook extensively and do practice questions. His exams are verbatim what he teaches in his lectures and what you attain from reading the textbook. He is quite rude to his students and often rushes through vital parts of the lecture slides without allowing enough time for you to copy it down. Lenjosek is not the nicest guy in the world nor tries to be. Even in office hours, he has difficulty explaining it in a way that makes sense to non-mathers. He's always complaining and he usually talks fast and doesn't provide the slides after. But abrasive, but only if you go against his clearly defined rules. Sometimes the stuff he talks about can be dry but he's accessible outside of class if you need to talk to him. Go to all lectures, listen to his advice, do applia. He gave me the impression that he did not want to be there when he was speaking. Not very enthusiastic but lectures are effective. Definitely cares about his students and wants them to succeed. If there was a definition for a heartless man, he'd be it. His lectures are long and even if he sees every single student tired, he wouldn't care. Do the work you'll get the grade you need. Likes to make obscure acronyms for words. Also writes formulas that don't make sense. ex: equity  assets - liabilities BUT assets  liabilities. Not a very exciting or helpful professor. He knows his stuff and you'll learn a lot in his class

Interesting...Some students left negative and sarcastic comments. Most classes i've had just tell you what other people (most dead long ago) think. She tells you what she thinks and then with the help of other theories explains it and adapts it to what's going on now.

Congratulations Mrs. She knows her subject very well. One of the very few teachers who actually cares whether you learn or not. gives you to read which are long articles). This professor is all about appearance and pleasing the students. Serious students who want some content, and who want to further their knowledge should avoid this teacher.

Professor: Vida Dujmovic
ITI1120: 
Postive Feedback: 
Amazing prof if you are just getting started in programming. You can tell she hopes for her students' success while also being realistic about their success. the class is okay for people who already know how to code but if you don't definitely learn in advance and do some projects. If you cheat, you will get caught for sure. If you come into the class with any programming experience, its an easy A. With that being said Vida is a great prof who cares greatly for both the subject and students. Her lectures are clear and have great explanations with enough examples to get you started. She cannot spell correctly in her own tests and she cannot describe clearly what she wants. Her tests were designed for longer than was given (I need more time to come up with solutions for coding questions). Having Professor Vida Dujmovic as one of my first professors at UOttawa was a blessing. This was my favorite class first semester. Prof Vida conveys the material very clearly and provides many examples throughout lectures, which are posted within 24hrs. The textbook is provided, I did not use it very often. She was very organized and her forums in the coursepage was very helpful. Aziz's class, as well as myself, an ITI1520 student, watch her lectures because she is simply BETTER in EVERY ASPECT. She teaches the material perfectly and doesn't overcomplicate anything. She's really nice and easy to follow during lectures, however there's a massive disparity in difficulty between the content she covers during class and the things you have to do for her assignments. Easily accessible and prompt&effective feedback after class. Although the assignments are a bit load but really helpful and practical. - Vida is one of the most organized profs I've ever seen. Very responsible prof who records all lectures online. All the lectures were recorded and the code from them was available as well which made studying a lot easier. Shes a very good professor and is very smart, but she is very mean, condisending, and has no patience for students who are not doing well. She was happy to see her student progress. Great first class and introduction to computer science using python. I would recommend taking your first year course with her. If you already know programming it is an easy A.   I liked the multiple choice exams. i love that she records lectures and codes along with us in class. you can also tell that shes funny and genuinely nice person. All of her lectures are recorded and she goes through everything step by step in front of you so it's easy to follow. Assignments are easy if you listen to all her lectures. All assignments are very clearly indicated, and she is quick to reply to any ambiguity via the online forum
Negative Feedback: 
Assignments are slightly difficult and sometimes time consuming but the tests are on the easier side. Heavy course load and have to put effort into it. Her assignments seemed hard but were not that hard. The midterm and final are difficult to study for since they don't give review for either. Her lectures, although I found them quite boring, were very informative and were key to understanding Python. I had very little programming experience, but I still got over 80%. This is a heavy workload class but if you put in the work, you'll get the A. however, i HATE her evaluations. this course can be hard if you do not have previous programming experience.
Neutral Feedback: 
Highly recommend taking ITI1120 with Prof. Vida. I learned a ton of concepts in a short amount of time due to her amazing lectures and difficult assignments. Good professor, assignments are extremely DIFFICULT but they prepare you well for the exams. This teacher is one to stay away from if you have the chance. Lectures are simple but the assignment are confusing. You will lose a lot of time either trying to understand what she wants or you will lose a lot of time coding the wrong thing because she misspelled it. You are either awarded with a generous 7 minutes extra of time as compensation or none. Her assignments and tests are confusing sometimes, but she tries her best to make it as clear as possible. Gives 7/14 days to complete assignments and possibilities to ask questions via discussion posts/office hours with TAs. Your marked by output, and her 70 min assignment period timeframe is too stressful to get her tests done and fully have it prepared for all cases. But assignments and exams are a whole different story. Unless you're a genius, expect a 60 in this course. I had the course ITI1120 with professor Dujmovic in Fall 2020. If you started out not knowing anything about Python, you could still receive an A+ because of her natural ability to teach. At first, you will think her assignments are hard and you don't want to take this course anymore. Her assignments are long for someone who's never coded before, but very doable. Her lecture is both clear whether you got in touch with programming or not. I did not feel very stressed with this course of remote class routine. She's good but make one small mistake on the tests and get ready to practically fail it because grading is output based. Her assignments are tough but WORTH DOING. Her assignments are harder than other sections, but they are what helped me learn the most. You will definitely need a lot of time to do her assignments. The professor taught the course material clearly. She would often use real-world examples that would help visualize the concept. Her lectures are posted on Brightspace, so attendance is not mandatory. Just make sure you don't fall behind or else you're screwed. She truly has a passion for coding and you can clearly see it. She recorded and post all the class video that help us understand. Shes one of few prof swho really care about her students. if you take her class in first year, great you actually have TIME to do her CRAZY HARD assignments. There's nothing new when it comes to mid term and exams. All exams and midterms are multiple choice (same everywhere). Explains well in class which is recorded and uploaded on her youtube channel for revision purposes. Lectures are spent doing the most basic program and you don;t learn mainly anything and then assignments are insane. Attend the lectures, and do practice problems. Too strict and the course is hard, midterm questions are very tricky. She did her lecture by showing how to write code from scratch and she will explain every syntax that she used. So as long as you know what you're doing it's fine. She is very clear in her lectures, so it shouldn't be a problem in understanding concepts. She had lots of office hours and ran on online discussion forum where you could get help. If you don't know the language being taught, you should attend all lectures and ask any questions you have, as she always monitors her online forum through blackboard. I came to the class with no clue how to even create a simple program. Does not accept lateness of submissions, and failures are failures - no exception

Professor: Michael Mulvey
ADM3321: 
Postive Feedback: 
Taking prof Mulveys class is a pure enjoyment because he is such a good storyteller. It is undeniable that the prof is a humorous and cool guy, but the lectures are oversimplified and abstract. I have a higher year course, which is asking, read an article and respond in 2-3 pg 2x spaced, for 15%. Hilarious guy, but not a good teacher; spends more time goofing off and talking about his life growing up than explaining course materials. Has weekly "dojo challenges" that start the first week; even though the deadline to switch into class is 3 weeks after; he won't allow you to make up for the ones missed if you switched. Really great prof with a fun and innovative teaching style. Course content is interesting and relatable and he's a fun guy to talk to. Prof Mulvey is amazing during the pandemic, he's easily best streamer I had since the start of online class. Nice professors always available for student. Lectures are not only inspirational, but also extremely memorable. His lectures are so engaging you forget you're at school. One of my greatest experiences at university thus far. Amazing professor, one of the best professors at Telfer. Knows how to keep your attention and makes class interesting. Loves to teach, he's funny, and gives good explanations. The course is very challenging, and to do well, you must read your textbook thoroughly and attend lectures. Great prof and very passionate/enthusiastic about his subject. Sincerely wants to help you with your future and is always available for questions. Mulvey teachs his stuff in such an interesting way that you even don't want to skip any class. Absolutely the best teacher I have had at UofO. He puts so much time and effort into his presentations. This is by far the best reacher i've had in university. This si the first class that i've actually done more work than required because it is so interesting
Negative Feedback: 
Single handedly one of the worst here at Telfer. Unless this is a compulsory course, I will not suggest taking it, at least not this prof
Neutral Feedback: 
He talks a lot about himself, (which is fine), but it can get kind of weird and excessive. He will not return your grades until you have graduated. It took him 3 months to return the midterm mark. The course deliverables are decent and clear if you pay attention to the class. This poor excuse of a prof doesn't even hand back the grades. Even in class, he doesn't actually teach, just talks about his life really. Unless this class is mandatory to you, I would not recommend taking this course as an elective since it demands a lot of your time due to heavy workload. Although Professor Mulvey was really good at lecturing, his course deliverables were so complex and tough to finish. Exams felt like that I was doing a MBA instead of a BCom degree. Only issue is his communication via email; takes forever to get back to students. Exams are straight forward and heavily based on the textbook. Mulvey is super passionate about his field. The group project has very unclear grading criteria, left up to students to decide what to do. Go to class because he shows videos and asks about them on exams. You have  several little assignments and a presentation, along with a midterm and final. Thank you professor Mulvey, you've enriched my studies. He demands alot from you as we are obtaining "higher education" so be ready to read your text and study hard to do well. This man can tell a story like no one else

He shows a lot of ad clips/video clips to convey the subject matter (very interesting). I would recommend him to anyone interested in Marketing.

It's a waste of time because we are going through the book

Do not need to attend his classes as his lectures are not reflective of the midterm or final at all. His exams are not HARD, but require studying and basic knowledge of the subject.

PHI2396: 
Postive Feedback: 
He just rambles on for the whole class and leaves it to the students to have an open discussion, which I suppose makes sense for a philosophy teacher, but most of the people who take this class are enrolled in a science program, so this kind of format is unfamiliar. This class certainly had the potential to be interesting, but it was not. His midterm had so many questions on it that were not covered. Honestly, he has a good heart, but the way he taught in this pandemic was not for me. Made zoom classes interesting and he showed us his chickens. This guy's so funny and probably the realest prof I've ever had. He's really good at leading discussions and gets you to think critically about ethical issues. Made the course so much easier than it would've been.
Negative Feedback: 
McKenna is by far and away the worst prof I've had so far. The midterm was extremely hard and did not care. The grading is extremely harsh on papers and doesn't even make sense. His multiple choice exams were unnecessarily difficult. The textbook was so poorly written and not relevant to bioethics - it was ridiculous
Neutral Feedback: 
Prof. Fully ignored the bio component of bioethics, so if you looking to take a philosophy class he's your guy. His expectations are extremely unclear for tests and papers. Lectures were one long rambling convrsation, with unclear connections to class content. Midterm was super hard and did not relate to what he taught. Almost never at his office hrs (held an O.H. while he was out on a run) and would reply to emails a week later. Just do everything you can to take bioethics with a diff prof. He really got rude in the end in my opinion. At first he showed so much empathy and patience and understanding of a student, but as soon as that final came he got aggressive in his tone he used with us. He didn't provide any instructions for the position paper or final exam. He didn't post the rubric for the final exam until 2 days before it was due, leaving many students confused and unsure of his expectations. Instructions are so unclear and it's not like he does anything to help. If you like a strucutred class with clear instructions and helpful material, do yourself a favor and take another prof. Oh and he wants us to write questions for him to use in his test bank next year... If this class wasn't mandatory I would have dropped it. He made breakout rooms constantly which did not help me. His lectures are so interesting and the topics are never ever dull

CDN1100:

Although a lot of reading is required, but he will give you the questions before the exams to prepare, so it's pretty fair. He gives questions ahead of time and his exams are pretty fair. It makes perfect sense to stay in a class that one hates. He is a great lecturer and his tests are pretty fair.

Straightforward lectures and responds quickly to emails and accommodation requests. A great professor who is very clearly passionate about what he's teaching.

I thought his labs were really well organized. The class is a lot and very time consuming, BUT you'll get good grades if you're competent since most of the stuff evaluated is pretty easy.

Doesn't answer questions and is very rude with students. DO NOT take this course unless youre forced to. Work load +++, very tough on exams and goes outside what was covered in labs

If this lab is not mandatory for you avoid it at all cost. He is unhelpful/vague during office hours. don't take this class unless you have to also note that it's also given by another prof in winter.

BCH3356: 
Postive Feedback: 
the hw instructions are very unclear so i recommend attending lectures. Does his review course but does not make the presentation of it available. There were many times I was fed up with his attitude and how he deals with things. Never went to his lectures but I was better off. If you have a choice, which I really hope you do, please avoid him. Does not post marks until the very end, which means you have no idea how you are doing in the class. I attended his office hours for questions and feedback, he was very kind, respectful and extremely helpful. The lab manual is filled with spelling errors and mistakes. Honestly, he makes metabolism pretty decent and his tests are fair. Lab component was tough, make sure you get a good partner. However, Luc gave a generous amount of free percent to the final grade, which helped a lot. He gives great feedback and is extremely approachable. Poitras is super helpful if you go to his office and even if he drops by your lab section. He gives great feedback on lab books and formal reports
Negative Feedback: 
the final exam is really difficult so maybe rewatch all the lectures to be prepared. lab manuel and protocols are extremely difficult to follow and poorly written. Watch the lecture before lab if you can, but you won't fail w/o it. almost everything is now application based because its online and Luc is not a nice man. he says things in the beginning of the course that might make you think he is but he comes off as passive aggressive sometimes as if he's being forced to teach. Refuses to regrade assignments when points were taken off unfairly. He's the worst prof I've encountered in all of uni. Gives the absolute worst instructions and everything is so unnecessarily confusing. Manual is long and tedious but it's helpful for studying. Final exam was brutal, heard he curves tho. The worst lab course I have taken so far.
Neutral Feedback: 
The lab itself was manageable but you are MAINLY interacting with TAs not Dr. Poitras. Lots of components to the grade: weekly readings + assignments, lab notebook, lab quizzes (participation), draft reports, final report, practical exam, and final exam. It is a pretty heavy course in-terms of workload. Id rather restart my entire undergraduate degree than have to ever take another course with this joke of a professor. Firstly, he's NOT an educator, I think he should stick to what he's OK at, lab work. Show up to lab prepared (read the lab procedures). For the exams, rewatch the lectures and when he says "I do this question every year" trust him and review the question. Refuse to correct the evaluations if there are errors. Don't warn in advance that only a portion of the ending is autocorrected to stress people out. Luc was condescending, passive aggressive toward lots of students including me with his emails and announcements. Very rude and very unclear of what is expected in the course. No email etiquette even though he preaches it. it was a very big mistake to be in his class. He is very rude towards students when they ask for help via email and he avoids answering questions, instead wants you to search on your own. He is so disrespectful, arrogant and unorganized (lab manuals were outdated which confused many students). Had to drop previously due to time constraints on a previous semester. His course was difficult but was very well designed to prime you with abilities you'll *absolutely* need if you intend on graduate school. The assignments and reports are time consuming and unclear. I agree with the previous comment, how can he abandon his students like that when so many other teachers are still dedicated to education. Do not take this lab as a science elective. Every percents was dedicated to something and you loose marks on everything. However, it felt that some concepts on assignments and exams came out of nowhere. Multiple lab reports, big final paper, prelabs, presentations, assignments, and lab prep. You need to know how to manage your time for this class. weekly 6 hour labs, weekly assignments, weekly pre-lab, in-lab presentations, a practical exam, weekly draft reports, a formal lab, and a final exam all for 3 credits only. he makes people wait in line for 50 minutes during his super short 1 hour office hours while answering someones questions, he's condescending and unfair. DGDs helped a lot with assignments and understanding the lab material. The lab material is relevant to outside lab work, but the manual is pretty poorly worded and confusing (even the TAs are confused too). Everyone around me and I have been getting 5/10 on the assignments. If you go to his office he will go above and beyond to help you. You'll actually learn some useful things in a lab course for once

Postive Feedback: 
Content was VERY interesting and slideshows were pretty organized. I typed out everything of what he said in class (made a doc over 350 pages) and made my own cheating sheet and got A+ on both midterms. You're given a task--teach hundreds of incredibly smart & motivated students paying thousands to hear you talk. Like what others said- his exams are extremely fair. pretty straightforward and easy to do well if you study his notes and understand the concepts (don't just memorize). The course seemed to get easier after the first midterm (my opinion)
Negative Feedback: 
Like a lot of my student colleagues mentioned, there is no email etiquette, no learning objectives, and vague exams. From PTSD from BCH2333, I took this course very seriously. After 4 years, Luc is easily the worst prof I've had. Makes exams way too long, speeds through 70 slide lectures and spends 10 minutes wasting class time talking about nonsense but blames his students asking questions as the reason to why he's so behind. The material isn't too difficult, everything you need to know is on the slides
Neutral Feedback: 
His explanations were sometimes disorganized. studied like hell and still couldn't shake a grade above an 80. The material is not difficult, but with no learning objectives, you're left trying to figure out what he may or not ask as there is a lot of information. You have to study WELL in advance to get an A in this class. Give yourself a lot of time to study tho. Lots of memorization and understanding how different pathways interact with each other. He also sometimes give hints about potential test questions. Complete 180 from mol bio where I wasn't his biggest fan.

Great prof, lectures are just him talking at you, but it's fairly easy to grapple with the subject matter. The assignments are straightforward and relatively easy but you should probably start them a week or two in advance. All seriousness, didn't enjoy class at all. Wolfgang is amazing if you want a 7-10 that lets you out at 8. BEST Prof Ever, super nice, amazing and understandable- sometimes the lectures can end up all over the place, but the means good. Literally the best professor I have ever gotten. Don't wanna skip his classes ever because they are literally the best. Lectures are dry, but he's hilarious and always cracking jokes to liven the mood. There's no blackboard for this course so its most definitely worthwhile to attend lectures, but he is very approachable about the class material. He's so nice and makes sure that all the material is understood. He is the most laid back professor you'll ever get. He just lectures (no powerpoints) which makes him really easy to follow along with. An extremely intelligent man always available for discussion after class. Very easy to reach if you have questions or need help.

Do you like taking massive amounts of notes through hard to follow lectures, just to get handed a midterm with 6 poorly designed questions that can be answered in 2 sentences. What should have been three hour lect never went past 1.5-2h.
Neutral Feedback: 
Im surprised by the amount of positive feedback. He basically marks arbitrarily and is hard to come by during his office hours. Also confused by the amazing ratings on here. I'm very confused about the positive feedback I've heard from other people on this prof because this was truly the most boring class I've ever taken, which was why I struggled to get a good grade- it was so hard to pay attention in class when I could motivate myself to even go. He doesn't use powerpoints, so ur just following his talking. Professor Koerner has a very clear structure of the class. There are two essays and a final, and the essays are easy enough. Although he is a very sweet guy, his lectures are super dry and you honestly do not have to attend any of them to do well. Beware, his lectures can be dry but no need to worry as essays and exams are easy. Only two 25% papers and a 50% final so your assignments really matter. If you end up having a 3 hour with him it's often that he lets students leave early. The way he explains the subject is so efficient when you're trying to remember all the content. The book isn't needed, you can just read the texts online. Papers reflect content, exams reflect content. He doesn't use virtual campus so you do need to attend his lectures, though he doesn't force you to. You get the info you need if you don't fall asleep in the process

He assigns a whole bunch of books and talks about a whole bunch of authors but never says anything about the books he gives us. He's really great at answering questions. It was a 7-10 class and we were out by 8:30pm at the latest. The two short term papers are extremely easy and straight forward. Take notes on everything he says and regurgitate it on the exam and you're golden (I got an A and didn't buy the textbook). Lectures are very detailed and if you take good notes you can write the essays and exam with only a little reading.

Take Koerner's classes every opportunity you have. Heck, i would take a Friday 8am Nuclear Physics class with him if he was the prof. He is one of the nicest prof I ever had at UOttawa. Go see him at office hours to get feedback before submitting your essay. Decent effort and you can get an A. He's a simple teacher. He took what would normally be a really boring class and made it way more bearable than I thought possible. If you go to class and just copy what he says, you'll never have to do a single reading. Ive had a couple classses with him now and the layout is 2 essays and a final in which he gives you the questions before hand and you get a cheat sheet
