professor,course,comment,date
Sam Alvaro,SOC,SOC2104. Goes off on random rants during class. All of his examples are super dated. Talks about research without referencing anything? His exams are all online which is good but they aren't about your knowledge but how well you can find VERY specific details in lectures/textbook. Condensing to points that differ from his. Will cut people off. ,2023-03-21 16:07:48
Sam Alvaro,SOC1104,"Very engaging lectures. Exams are multiple choice but they are VERY poorly made. It's either copy-pasted questions directly from the class slides (easy) or impossible questions from the textbook (insanely specific things that you can't possibly remember or questions that have two possible correct answers, but only one is ""right"" according to him).",2023-02-28 15:21:39
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"2104* The content in this course is interesting, however, I find this prof very condescending to students who speak up and in many instances, inappropriate. He does not post the lecture slides anywhere and does not give any sort of exam review. Pay very close attention to the details in the readings because it will probably be on the midterm/exam.",2023-02-14 14:40:45
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Exams are hard (30/30/40 split, 1min per MC) and all online with no lockdown software. The textbook is very expensive and required, along with very dense. Stick to reading chapter summaries and you'll be fine. His exams are taken word for word from Quizlets. Alvaro can be condescending and rude when you ask a question, and lectures are very fast.",2023-01-10 21:37:47
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Alvaro is obsessed with being perceived as cool and with the times. He makes unfunny jokes about TikTok, furries and the Kardashians. He is very condescending when students share their opinion in class. READ THE TEXTBOOK he copy pastes passages on exams verbatim. All his exams and midterms are online which is nice. Notes are not posted anywhere.",2023-01-09 22:41:35
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Great professor, get ready to be quizzed on the most detailed bits of information from the textbook. The midterms were difficult (1 question per minute online), however, he does offer a 2% bonus to your final mark if you complete an assignment. His slides were huge chunks of information that he couldn't be bothered to turn into bullet points. ",2023-01-05 16:06:51
Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Very funny and entertaining professor. Lectures were decently enjoyable. Only complaint is that some questions on exams are based on small, easy-to-miss details in the textbook.",2022-12-04 04:39:06
Sam Alvaro,1300,Good prof. Hard tests though.,2022-11-24 17:01:10
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof Alvaro is 1 of the best profs I've had. He connects with students (bring up the Kardashians and TikTok ALL the time). He is really funny and keeps the classes engaging. Attendance isn't mandatory, but he doesn't post lectures or PP, and the reading is mandatory for the exams (which are pretty easy). If you can, take a class with Prof Alvaro! ",2022-11-23 15:12:17
Sam Alvaro,1300,"Would not recommend !! There are 3 tests overall, two midterms each worth 30% and one final worth 40%. There are 60 questions and 65 minutes for the test, it is all multiple choice and half of those questions are on the readings. He does not post the lecture material online so be prepared to type fast, class average on tests is around 69.7%. ",2022-11-15 20:28:32
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I enjoyed this class however, I did not enjoy Dr. Alvaro. All of the Zoom sessions were just crazy discussions about things that had nothing to do with class - 3 hour long discussions. ",2022-08-01 19:05:27
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,Very good prof and loves what he does which is criminology,2022-06-25 23:38:41
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,Prof Alvaro makes the best use of technology and sparks great conversation. Going to class is optional but shouldn't be missed because discussion-based learning means a lot of material is covered through real-world examples. There is so much reading though and you will be tested on it. Don't take this class if you prefer lecture-based courses. ,2022-05-15 15:10:01
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"A very humorous and hilarious professor,the lectures are very exciting and I benefited a lot. However, the exam is really difficult. Although all the questions are multiple choice, I feel that a lot of knowledge has not been taught, but it appeared in the midterm and Final exam.The exam content is very detailed!",2022-05-07 20:09:14
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"All material for exams come from his recorded videos, long articles, and the textbook. His lectures are a waste of time since he barely discusses all of the content during class time. His exams cover very specific details of his recorded videos and the textbook, they are not easy. Any prof is better than Alvaro, avoid him if you can.",2022-04-24 03:20:47
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I attended his lecture once in person and it genuinely made me cry. He is extremely condescending and confrontational, every chance he gets. He makes you have name plates for discussions during class, and then proceeds to butcher your name pronunciation anyways, regardless of if you correct him or not. TA's do everything for him. TA's are great.",2022-03-29 14:48:20
Sam Alvaro,1300,I swear he must be writing the good reviews on here lol! He is an awful prof! I would not recommend him to anyone! He is condescending! He also test on minute details from the textbook! Avoid !!,2022-03-08 09:31:44
Sam Alvaro,CRM2305,"Professor goes on hour long tangents in class and then removes those tangents from the recorded lectures and he then turns his nigh on incomprehensible ramblings into testable content. Contradicts himself constantly, has horrible organization and you better memorize that textbook like gospel.",2022-02-11 19:25:00
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Honestly one of the best profs i've had at UOttawa. He's absolutely hilarious and super fun! Attendance is definitely mandatory because classes a re not recorded. However, I had a 3 hour lecture with him every Thursday night and it flew by. He includes his students in discussion throughout the lecture and is very clear on material and assignments.",2022-01-21 01:11:24
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Such a useless prof. Gets paid 100k to post prerecorded lectures that were completely edited by his TA's. Taught myself the entire course through the textbook. Actually showing up to class is a waste of time, all we did was kahoots and he made cringy jokes. Midterms and exam completey based on random tidbits of info in the textbook, so goodluck.",2021-12-17 02:01:37
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"I had this prof once a week for about 2.5 hours, and that's probably the only negative aspect of the class. Prof. Alvaro himself is really engaging; he likes interacting with students and tries to get to know everyone. Plus, he's really knowledgeable about the subject and prefers to teach Crim through group discussions.",2021-12-13 00:47:27
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"His video lessons are very visual, which was super nice, but the lectures are a total waste of time !! I wish we went over the material during them ... instead, he does kahoots and talks to the class.",2021-12-10 01:05:28
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,The exams he makes are ridiculous and he does not go over anything in his lectures.,2021-12-01 20:48:42
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,The classes are 3 hour long but not much is done in those hours and it is not useful for exams.,2021-11-24 19:52:02
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Tests/exams are super hard. Super reading-based, make sure you take DETAILED notes. Class is a waste of time but hours of lecture content is posted online instead",2021-11-20 17:50:51
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"lectures were a huge waste of time. our three hour lectures, that would consist of stupid kid games and random conversations would always be cut about an hour short because there ""wasn't enough content to fill three hours"" but he would post hours worth of information for us to teach ourselves throughout the week. avoid at all costs!! smh",2021-11-01 22:16:17
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"do ! not ! take ! his ! class !! worst prof ever and doesnt even teach! lectures are just games which is annoying bc the tests are hard and based on the material he doesnt actually go thru. it takes all my will to get thru his ""lectures"" bc of his unfunny jokes. too many assignments and too arrogant for someone who does not do much",2021-10-25 02:06:22
Sam Alvaro,ANT2103,His exams really rely on the textbook/reading materials so make sure you really take notes. It won't be hard to get a good grade if you really pay attention. His live lectures aren't really related to the course material unless it's a powerpoint. He's a funny guy tho.,2021-10-21 17:11:13
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"Stop whatever you're doing, and TAKE HIS CLASS I would do it all over again!!!",2021-07-29 00:07:01
Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Okay, so I took it as a summer course from 7-10 pm. And honestly I Never attend my classes but I literally never skip this one. He is interesting and makes the topic relatable to daily life. He engages with students and is clear on instructions and marks fairly.",2021-07-11 16:15:03
Sam Alvaro,SOC2312,Such a good class and you get the grade for the work you put in! Really reading heavy but the assignments are easy to do and thoughtfully spaced out. Lots of discussion in the class time. Prof Alvaro wants you to do well and the TA was so helpful. Loved this class!,2021-06-13 14:13:28
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I liked the material but I did not like the professor. His live lectures were useless and he wouldn't talk about the actual material. His posted lectures are animated videos, which might seem stupid but they were actually entertaining. His exams were very specific and you needed to know every little detail about the readings and lectures.",2021-05-23 17:27:40
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,tests have nothing to do with what we were lectured on! stay away!,2021-05-18 21:27:27
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,professor alvaro is hard but fair in my opinion. there is a lot of material but he doesn't discuss any new matieral in the live lectures and they're kind of a waste of time. the tas weren't sociology students so they weren't much help for content related things. definitely not a bird course but still interesting,2021-05-03 21:52:15
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Speaking from taking the course online. Cool guy, terrible prof. He expects way too much from his students. Like are we really going to remember a small insignificant statement from the first week of class? His lectures are not interesting enough to ask such specific questions on a final. If youre looking for an fun, easy elective this aint it.",2021-04-27 16:26:04
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"SOO condescending and acts likes he's the best prof (when he's definitely not )! Very very rude during class and when students are done talking he states ""are you done now "" AVOID at all costs and save yourselves...",2021-04-25 20:36:56
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Amazing recorded lectures with fun animation in it. Reading the textbook is very important. He gave out two midterms.,2021-04-10 17:55:58
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"He didn't even give us lecture notes or powerpoint slides, so I basically had to write out everything he said during the lecture videos, which was extremely exhausting. Not only that, but he made one of the assignments due during Reading Week. Avoid this prof if you can.",2021-02-15 23:53:29
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Do NOT take him! His tests have literally nothing to do with the material he tells you to study! And he doesn't use his lecture time effectively at all! Also, he is condescending!",2021-02-08 16:05:12
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,Avoid him if you can. There's so much reading to do in this class. The class is cumulative. He uses the class time to discuss the class content and answer questions which is fine. His midterms are 50 questions and gives you 50 min to answer them. He gives out discussion assignments and they are time consuming and worth like 5% at most,2021-01-12 22:03:29
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"He makes you work for the grade thats for sure. But as long as you do ALL the readings and attend all the lectures and pay attention, youll do fine! For his online class, he used the live class time to do discussions and take questions. He sometimes comes off as lazy however. I think thats because his TAs do most of the work for the class.",2021-01-07 22:08:05
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,I would never take his classes ever again (I had 2 at the same time). Blogs were a lot of work (essay style) and were worth 2-4% per each. Exams were extremely hard with no time (50 mins per 50 questions) and did not include course content. Inappropriate topics and the TAs did all the work and I felt that they were under a lot of stress.,2021-01-06 15:16:13
Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"Horrible teacher, horrible grading system, gets his TAs to do everything for him. also rude lol. i wouldnt take his classes if ur not willing to dedicate 100% of ur time to it",2020-12-25 04:17:08
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Although the class content is interesting, much of what is learned is never on the exams. This is further complicated by the fact that Alvaro is a lazy condescending prof who acts like a know it all but is unavailable to answer questions both in and outside class.",2020-12-21 19:17:35
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Tough class to do online. Reading is endless, he doesnt seem to care about most students. Talks about inappropriate topics, we had a survey about our sex life that was worth a portion of your grade so not really optional. Discussion assignments are worth 2-5% but are very time consuming. Avoid this class and the prof if possible.",2020-12-21 08:18:55
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"This teacher gave me depression, I am going through mental trauma after these exams they questions have no connection with the course material. highly disturbing do not recommend one bit.",2020-12-18 23:49:27
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"LOL, I just notice that he literally put a lot of PUA-related content in his lectures.",2020-12-15 05:16:59
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Exams barely reflect lecture content, if at all. Midterms are 50 questions in 50 minutes, including more than a few vignettes. It's also become apparent that he just uses a question bank since the last midterm, some people randomly also got 1-4 short answer questions others only multiples choice, and more than a few others had duplicate questions.",2020-11-25 12:05:50
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"The class material is so easy and straightforward but prof Alvaro makes it so difficult. There are SO many readings, mainly articles and journals, and you are tested based on the smallest details from these readings. Lectures are useless, no class material is taught. Expectations for assignments/tests are non-existent so you get awful grades",2020-11-24 23:13:11
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Avoid Avoid Avoid A lot of readings, unclear rubric for assignments or discussion boards, unclear instructions for exams, unclear and irrelevant questions in exams, chaotic gradings, literally wasting student's time, weird assignment topics. He literally gives everything to his TAs and not take any responsibilities.",2020-11-17 01:12:17
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Worst prof Ive ever had avoid if possible!! Heavy textbook readings, articles then tested on the smallest details. Doesnt lecture, uses class time for discussion then brushes off all student concerns. Time consuming discussions worth almost nothing, TAs do all the work for him. I was constantly ignored when asking questions, extremely rude prof",2020-11-11 02:24:18
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"God he's so bad at teaching. Doesn't show up to class half the time for no reason. Brushes off all complaints. Doesn't listen to students. Also cringy and pretentious. Tries really hard to be ""hip and cool"" but it doesn't work. Seriously though, he grades tough, doesn't give proper instructions on assignments, doesn't listen to student feedback.",2020-11-11 00:14:11
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"This prof has no idea what he's doing. He's one of those ""I want my class to appear hardcore and not easy!"" Content is easy. Prof will throw assignments at you left n right, grade you unfairly, with no rubric for you to go off of. Doesn't care what you say either won't listen. He's a legitimate piece of trash. Doesn't care about student wellbeing",2020-11-11 00:11:29
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"He couldn't care less for his students. He puts up a front like he is super cool and chill and wants everyone to succeed. However, the large majority of his test questions come from textbook test banks. It's useless to study class notes. His rubrics are also very broad and unclear. Also very condescending when answering students questions. AVOID!!!",2020-11-03 23:10:39
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Fun guy, but I'm lucky I only have one class with him. Don't take him if not necessary.",2020-10-24 19:24:56
Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"He is not funny and people need to stop pretending he is. Ridiculously condescending, picks on students, and embarrasses them in class when they ask questions (which is really unfortunate for first-years who are adapting). Don't fall for the snapchat selfie. If you need help, ask a TA. They do all the work for him. Wish I had something nicer to say",2020-10-02 01:35:08
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Classes were interesting. Tests were hard. He was a very lazy prof, and had a temper. He let his TA do all the work and didn't do any one-on-one interaction with students at all. Exams were based solely on the readings, making class attendance useless. I am glad that I only had one class with him.",2020-08-14 01:01:45
Sam Alvaro,SOC3331,"He is a good professor, passionate and interesting. He is intimidating however and often made fun of our responses. You MUST do the readings in order to succeed on the exams. He will take specific parts of the readings for questions, so you won't get by just by skimming them.",2020-07-22 15:25:38
Sam Alvaro,SOC3118,He's a great professor! He has an intimidating personality but his jokes are hilarious. Lectures are a very BRIEF summary of the readings so make sure you read ALL of the readings CAREFULLY. Midterms and final are fair. Just don't miss class and do all the readings and take really good reading notes.,2020-06-16 20:22:42
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Great lecturer, great human being. Just his exams. I've never taken a worser exam in my life. Completely randomized textbooks questions. I studied for weeks prior, memorized nearly all the class notes & took extensive notes on the textbook. Still was never able to break an A. . Goodluck, you'll need it. And Trevor is a beauty of a TA.",2020-04-27 00:24:56
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He's an excellent and interesting lecturer, extremely good at explaining criminological concepts which was very fresh and engaging to listen to. Test content is a nightmare though, you will spend a LOT of time with your textbook. Open book exams, but all multiple choice with odd diction. Id rec him IF you have lots of free time to read. Decent!",2020-03-30 17:14:03
Sam Alvaro,CRIM1300,"He was super funny and interesting, and the lectures were fun at times. This is a class where you have to go 100% of the time and read ALL of the texts (in detail). The exams are online but they include even the most minor details from the textbook or lectures. If you want an A, you need to work HARD.",2020-02-23 15:26:43
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,His lectures are engaging however as mentioned before he IS a very lazy prof. All midterms online so you can work with friends etc (recommended) but they have nothing to do with what he teaches in class? Scared to put my hand up bc he often mocks students in front of the class. Interesting content so a shame he lacks effort/passion as an educator.,2020-02-21 20:31:34
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Lectures are note heavy, he doesn't upload ANYTHING online. Lectures barely used in tests, which are usually focused on the texts and textbook, on the smallest details. Would NOT recommend, worst prof I had in first year.",2020-02-13 01:32:37
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He is the worst professor I have had at U of O. He doesnt not care for his students, as his tests do not reflect what he teaches. The questions on the test are about random facts from the textbook, which shows that he is a lazy professor, as he does not make the questions himself. He does not care for his students, and I would AVOID at all costs!!",2020-01-10 16:41:53
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof Alvaros lectures are interesting, but that is the only positive thing I can say about his classes. The tests are all online and do not match what he teaches in class. Many of the questions are small facts that are buried in the textbook. He does not put the time in to help students, which shows that he is a selfish and careless professor.",2020-01-10 16:38:43
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,For all of you saying his midterms don't reflect the class material and are mainly from the textbook... get used to it in your upper year classes. Maybe that's why I wasn't so upset when I actually DID the readings and got an A- in the course. Teachers aren't going to just hand you material for you to memorize you have to work for it.,2019-11-06 21:36:37
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,good lecturer but lazy prof. His exams are computer generated so the questions come from random details in the text. Avoid him if you want an A,2019-08-28 02:51:49
Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,By far the worst prof I've had is far! What you are tested on on exams and tests are so random. His lectures are super interesting but who cares about an interesting prof if you can't get a good grade? WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!,2019-07-11 16:40:35
Sam Alvaro,CMN1300,"Out of my 10 first year profs ... he is by far the worst! He is funny and his lectures are interesting, but you are not graded on the lectures at all!!! Good luck remembering the smallest of details from the textbook !! You can write the exam from home, and even with friends from the class? No regulations ... u can use google when writing the exam",2019-04-13 07:51:25
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Just wrote his crm1300 final... the exam DID NOT reflect what we talked about in class! Everything is small details from the textbook, and not fundamental aspects of criminology.. absolutely terrible prof and teaching style!! Everything is online so you can google or work with friends , but that is not impartial and fair to ur actual knowledge!!!",2019-04-12 15:42:46
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"I enjoy his classes, they are very fun! After that, it all goes down hill. His tests are not on what he talks about in class!! Very frustrating! His questions are based around minute details in the textbook... its a 500 page textbook. His grades discussions are marked on how to cite properly ... even though we have never talked about it in class??",2019-04-11 05:49:23
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"He seems to be a nice guy, but he is not passionate about teaching. He gives you an entire textbook and then tests you on it. Do NOT be fooled, it is hard. His lectures are engaging, but you are not really tested on his lectures, and are tested on the textbook. His tests use odd diction, so it is easy to get questions wrong for no reason... AVOID",2019-04-11 00:10:16
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"His lectures are very interesting, for he discusses pop culture very often. Although, on saying this, his class is very tough. His exams are multiple choice with only a minute per question. You must read the textbook because that is where all of his difficult questions come from. For a first year intro class he is very hard, but he is a fun prof.",2019-04-04 00:35:11
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Very good prof, his lectures are engaging and interesting. Although you do learn a lot in his class, his exams are very very tough. Be prepared to study very hard for his exams.",2019-04-02 20:29:45
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,He doesnt post his notes and has lots of discussions not related to course material. His tests are online but you have 50 minutes to answer 50 questions and they are hard. 5 discussions online and the TA is a hard grader with no helpful feedback. I regret BIG time taking this class as an elective. I would NEVER reccomend this class to anyone.,2019-04-01 01:13:25
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Prof is hilarious, makes references to pop culture to make the content relatable and relevant. Participation is encouraged and he will call on people randomly. midterm and final are online and theres a paper. slides are NOT posted online and no laptops so you gotta go to class and write them in a notebook. overall decent though",2019-01-07 19:29:04
Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,"This class was my only class this semester I actually looked forward to/enjoyed going to. He is always updated on current events as well as pop culture, and speaks to a very 'hip' and current/modern audience. Midterms and exams are online and straight multiple choice, which I found to be nice as you have your notes in front of you.",2018-11-21 16:49:14
Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,"Very engaging prof as well as cares about his students. Your insight is valued and considered, and he is always trying to stay up to date in pop culture to make lectures relatable. He relies a lot on brightspace and all exams are done online but if you do not mind that I highly recommend him as a prof. Easily my favourite prof this semester",2018-11-10 17:06:55
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"This teacher doesn't care about the students. His exams are online that consist of 50 multiple choice questions. You only have 1 minute to answer each question. Lots of readings and no study guideline to the exams. His classes are usually 2-3 hours and he doesn't allow breaks, would not take a class with him again.",2018-11-04 11:34:15
Sam Alvaro,SOC1106,Prof Alvaro is very funny and makes sure to use lots of pop-culture references so we can better understand the subject matter - he even uses references SO current that the students don't even know about it yet. Make sure you attend every lecture since he doesn't post anything online and most discussion boards / projects have to do with the lectures,2018-10-31 21:52:59
Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,"I took this as a summer course. Dr. Alvaro did not account for the fact that there was 1/4 of the time to complete the online discussion questions (5 questions, 1000 words each, worth a total of 10%). Because of the short amount of time, it seemed like a lot of work for not very much of our grade. The online M/C exams were a lot of ""who said what"".",2018-06-14 13:25:50
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Hes a fun prof, and his lectures are discussion based. He doesnt post notesso make friends if you like to skip class. All exams are online, but theyre difficult. Read the textbook because most questions are from there.",2018-05-12 01:34:20
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"His lectures were amazing. He was super chill and was always listening to people's opinions. Class had an ""open discussion"" style which i liked. There were 5 discussions that you had to do during semester on brightspace (10%). The 2 midterms and final were ALL online (!!) You had 1 min to answer each Q. This was good for some, others not so much.",2018-05-10 15:13:02
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Dr Alvaro gets off topic A LOT but he makes class really fun by making connections with things his students can relate to. He doesnt post his slides so you have to go to class, has like 5 online discussions throughout the term. His exams are all online which is really nice bc u can put less emphasis on it. Textbook is so boring tho but necessary!",2018-05-02 16:29:05
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"BEST PROF EVER! enrol in his class if you get the chance, you wont' regret it. Hilarious lectures that make the info easy to remember. Midterms and final online really helped. Downfall is powerpoints aren't online.",2018-04-29 18:56:54
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,Alvaro is a very engaging prof!! He made each lecture engaging every. single. time. Also the extra credit he gave for attendance (1% extra if you are in class when the attendance is 60%) helped me out a lot! The two midterms and final are online but BE CAREFUL because they are all multiple choice- its not as easy as it sounds!,2018-04-29 18:48:31
Sam Alvaro,SOC1105,"This prof only uses Brightspace to evaluate students, including ALL of the exams. There were many technical difficulties throughout the semester with many students and he wouldnt help any of them. He would say to the entire class why dont you just CALL Brightspace? Do the readings or you wont pass. Avoid if you can.",2018-04-27 16:11:25

Sam Alvaro,CRM1301,Professor Alvaro makes the class so much fun. He literally tries to relate to you in any aspect and is always joking around which usually makes a 3 hour class tolerable.

Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"Great engaging professor. Made 8:30am lectures very bearable to attend. Only negative is that his exams are multiple choice and involve some very random and specific questions! Get the textbook, you will need it for exams.",2016-04-20 16:44:13
Sam Alvaro,SOC2306,"If you need a bird class, take him. Multiple choice exams, straight forward. You probably won't learn much, most of the things we cover are things that you probably already know but hey we all need that easy to pass class! Doesn't post online so you have to go to class.

I took his crim1300 course first semester and changed my electives to take his soc1101 for second semester.

Easy, but not worth it.",2016-01-09 21:20:50
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Great Prof. He makes his lectures very interesting and engaging, although pay attention because he does not post slides to Blackboard.

Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Enthusiastic and engaging (and funny!) prof but the lectures are basically a vague recounting of the weeks reading. A lot of reading, both a textbook and a course reader and ALL are mandatory to pass. Weekly journals make sure of this. He does call on people and can tend to embarrass them so beware if you have anxiety about speaking in class. ",2015-10-15 13:42:42

Make sure you buy the text B, tests come from reading",2015-01-04 16:42:34
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Hilarious and awesome dude, except for the fact that he only prefers his answers for questions asked in class.

Overall interesting course, except thoroughly biased by Alvaro.",2014-12-14 20:26:51
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,He's a hilarious prof and made lectures go by quickly! His midterms are easy if you attend all the classes (since notes aren't posted online) and read the textbook.

Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Two MC midterms based solely off the readings so going to class was pointless in that perspective but the professor himself was what made the classes worth going too.

Would 100% recommend this professor if possible!",2014-11-16 22:24:31
Sam Alvaro,SOC1101,"I really enjoyed Alvaro's teaching style. At first I was taken aback that he didn't put the slides up on Blackboard, but I think it really helped motivate me to concentrate.

READING ARE MANDATORY; and heavy on reading materials (my only complaint)..",2014-05-05 16:35:31

He is kind of arrogant, but what do you expect from a young Prof who teaches CRIM and Policing. IF you READ the book and TAKE NOTES, you will do well. IF not, you won't. Quite simple",2008-12-20 12:38:01
Sam Alvaro,SOCA,"I find Sam's classes to be relatively easy. I've him twice now and I loved how both classes were strictly mulitple choice exams. You can pretty much show up and get by on them without attending class. When I did attend I thought he came across as a funny guy, not especially helpful though, as he tends to rip on a lot of students.",2008-12-13 10:53:13
Sam Alvaro,SOC2109,"Sam ""The Man"" Alvaro! -- I took soc-psych with him. He is a very intelligent young professor and conveys the subject matter effectively; however, the exams can be challenging because it requires you to have complete knowledge of the book/CR/Lecs. Not only did i enjoy his class but I made a good friend. Recommend any class Sam is affiliated with!",2008-11-21 18:12:46
Sam Alvaro,SOC3117,"Probably the worst professor I've ever had.  He was so disinterested in what he was teaching that I found myself bored and unmotivated constantly.  His form of help consisted of telling me that I was floundering but that I wasn't ""dumb"".  He did not know what was on his own slides most of them time and gave poor examples in class.",2008-10-24 12:21:26
Sam Alvaro,SOC3117,"For a methods summer class it was awesome. It was a ton of work, but Sam was always there to answer questions and help out when we got stuck. Great Prof!!!!!!!",2008-09-25 22:41:17

It's an interesting class, but i wouldn't take another course with Alvaro.",2008-05-05 21:07:23
Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"This guy should be teaching more classes at Ottawa U, he actually makes going to class worthwhile and is extremely interesting,class always goes by fast when he is teaching.

Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"If you do well on MC exams, then you'll excel, but if you're not, I suggest choosing another course.  My other courses were MUCH harder and I received A's. I got a B in his class.  Writing the optional paper wouldn't have helped since most people did poorly on it as well.  The course material is very theoretical and uninspiring.",2008-01-10 10:32:17
Sam Alvaro,CRMSECT,"I am back and forth with this prof/course... The mid-term followed the 1st half of the course well, but the final was REALLY difficult I think.

He is a good professor - I'm just unsure about how to be really successful in this course.",2007-12-31 01:15:49
Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Class was interesting enough.  The midterm and exam had nothing to do with the course. You honestly don't ever need to go to class, just memorize the textbook!

Study and you'll do fine and make sure to read the text book and DON'T do the essay, bad idea.",2007-10-17 21:29:39
Sam Alvaro,CRMSOC,"I had this guy for 2 classes, and will take his class again just because they are that great. I will admit that I would do him in an instant too, great lectures tho. He kinda looks like the cop from Heroes, maybe not to you, but to me, yes. I'd so tap that in an instant. But it's not just looks, it's personality . Really interesting lectures too :)",2007-10-17 20:29:05

I'm a gradate student now at another university and there are only a handful of professors at the University of Ottawa that actually prepared me for graduate school. He was one.

Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"a jerk. doesn't answer questions with proof or arguments, just insults or jokes to get the dumb  kids in class to laugh. insults intelligent students by treating the entire class like first year  soc students (who all drop out) even though a class survey showed most of us were 4th years looking for an easy credit. read the text, memorize powerpoint",2007-07-24 16:15:10

Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,"Really interresting class... he is very good at keeping our attention on the material.

There is barely any direction as to how he wants it....",2007-05-04 02:31:28

Sam Alvaro,CRM1300,"Sam's a real nice guy, I asked him for a letter for a graduate school and he went out of his way to  help me out and who I should talk to. For a part-time prof he really does go out of his way more than the full-timers.",2006-05-05 19:37:12

Sam Alvaro,SOC2106,A confident teacher but too full of himself. Seems to take pleasure in embarrassing students who offer up answers to questions.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Funny guy. Lecture material is EXTREMELY BORING. Podcasts saved my life. Study early or else you will hate yourself. Answers to questions are extremely specific, so don't try to guess.",2016-12-09 22:57:43
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His website is incredible, he gives you -exactly- what you need to succeed in his class. He's not easy to talk to, at all, but his lectures are top notch. Be sure you know exactly what is going on, because if you word a definition or mechanism weird or incorrectly, it is wrong, he can be pretty specific that way.",2016-12-08 22:51:51
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I was in his last ever BIO1130 class, I leave this review as a relic for future uOttawa students who have dodged this bullet.  He's extremely pompous. It's like he knows that the material is not hard so he fills his midterms with trick questions so that you feel like it is. He uses long words just to confuse people but they're not used correctly.",2016-12-07 15:42:55
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman was the Prof I was warned about. Though his marking scheme is tremendously hard, I looked forward to his lectures.

There is a lot of work involved in studying but it is worth it",2016-12-01 12:35:30
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"To pretty much summarize it, Houseman is an amazing professor, he really seems to love what he's doing and explains everything in his lectures detail by detail. BUT, his exams are the hardest things you will ever do in your entire life. You think you understand everything, and BOOM. Nope, you failed.",2016-11-30 10:27:54
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I was honestly very scared coming into this class because I heard so many bad things about him, but he is such a good professor who really knows his material and is passionate about what he is teaching. May be a little arrogant and all of the information tested is based on what he says word-for-word - so read his blurbs and pay attention in class!",2016-11-16 23:07:11
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The course he teaches is extremely complicated and FULL of information. His exams are also graded very strictly. However, he has MANY resources on his website that make the learning extremely effective. If you put the effort in and use his resources effectively you will learn a ton and do well! His lectures are great and interesting and he's funny!",2016-11-06 14:17:12

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Hated him then changed my mind after BIO1140. Very good lecturer, clear and precise. THE KEY TO DOING WELL IS: go to class cuz the podcasts are really boring to get through, write WORD FOR WORD notes, watch podcasts before exams to touch up notes, memorize crosswords for exams, and redo past midterms. Don't buy the textbooks. BLESS THE BELL CURVE",2016-07-01 16:11:20
Jon Houseman,BIO1530,"Funny guy, Interesting lectures",2016-06-15 13:31:34
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Good lecturer just very difficult for incoming first year students to adapt to. Puts in a lot of effort in his study materials. USE HIS CROSSWORDS:15-20 marks per exams are word for word the crosswords. Key words are stressed but there's so many they're more a time waster than anything. Need to study and work really hard to do well but it pays off,2016-06-10 00:38:33
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Houseman can be unforgiving but he is a fantastic lecturer. The key to doing well in any of his courses is writing down every word he says like a transcript and using that to study. He does give you lots of resources to succeed and expects his students to use them. He always adds 0.7% to your final grade and bell curves the exams.,2016-06-08 20:44:22
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Horrible teacher. I literally switched programs for the sole reason to not have to retake this class. There is just WAYYY too much to study to be able to do well, especially for first year. Over half the class failed my year and he ""did us the favour"" to bell so that only HALF the class failed. Test are so hard",2016-05-24 08:31:51
Jon Houseman,BIO2135,"Houseman is a great lecturer, even though he may talk super fast. Definitely go to class AND watch the podcasts.

I liked him much better now than in first year!",2016-05-14 14:32:12

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Worst prof ever..... he doesn't emphasize which info is important and what is not and considering he doesn't have words on the powerpoint you have to take everything he says as something of essence to only get screwed over on the marking scheme and surprise questions that he said wouldn't be on the exam...,2016-05-02 13:34:59
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is one of the best profs I've had. His tests are really detailed and you need to study for them. If you don't study you're unlikely to pass, but just a little bit of studying and you're good. He explains the material really well, but you have to be in class to benefit because not all of it is caught on the podcast.",2016-04-19 14:06:01

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Never had a prof so generous with marks like houseman i mean theres profs that give you a big bump up one time in your life but houseman every midterm and the final. dont speak up in class tho as he'll embarrass you lool but other then that i thought the course was really easyyy just memorizeee the podcasts!,2016-04-14 17:31:17
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"His lectures are very informative and he is very good at keeping the students attention for the 80 minutes he has. His marking scheme is very tough.

He's pretty hilarious sometimes.",2016-04-04 18:04:08
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"cherish this prof while you can. While there is a ton of material and you will find yourself crying before the midterms and exam, he provides you with all the resources you need and his midterms are not a surprise if you studied hard for them, you'll miss him once you get to second semester biology lol.",2016-04-01 20:42:20

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Lectures are v organized, online blurbs reinforce concepts, txtbook readings give you extra examples and the crosswords basically hand you 20 free marks when it comes to midterms/final.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The key to doing well in this class is studying material from a variety of sources: his lectures/rewatching podcasts, the crosswords, the blurbs on his website, and the textbook. It's a lot of work, but manageable if you start early. Labs and quizzes are mark boosters. The prof is a good lecturer and is very knowledgable, but can be condescending.",2016-02-06 23:32:58
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Very entertaining and was always looking forward to the next joke he was going to say. I always went to class and would have to re-watch the podcasts for every class because there is so much material and so much said that you dont have enough time to write or type it all down. DO THE CROSSWORDS. Word for word fill in the blanks are on the tests.,2016-02-05 19:07:55
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Worst experience of my life. There is so much material packed into one course and learning 750 keyword definions for the final was an impossible task even though. I started studying the moment we got the materials but no matter how much I studied it was just a lot. Avoid at all costs or you're in for the most stressful 4 months of your life.,2016-01-29 20:24:10
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Good class!  Very well organized!  Prof gives you all the material you need to succeed, just takes time to make use of it all.  Do the crosswords, they show up as the fill in the blank questions on the midterms and finals!  Stay on top of material all along, don't leave it till the last day. Only take this class if you have to, not a good elective!",2016-01-27 21:25:35
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"It was a really tough class, a lot of content and the midterms and exam were difficult. He is a great lecturer though, very dynamic. The whole class is very well organized, use the resources available to you. There are podcasts but they don't replace going to class.",2016-01-27 08:50:18
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He's a good talker. Lectures are fun to attend. He gives you a lot of material to prepare you for his exams. Make sure you watch the podcasts 2-3 times before every exam and make notes. Attend the class; things stick more easily that way. Do only the keywords you think you have no idea about.  His midterms were hard but the final was okayish,2016-01-18 18:08:09
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"OKayyyy we might as well get settled in and get started. Fair class. Put in the work, get the grade you want.",2016-01-18 14:59:21

Make sure to use the resources he provides on his website, they're super helpful.",2016-01-16 23:15:47
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"You definitely have to put in effort for this class. There are A LOT of concepts and keywords to memorize and understand.

However, it is possible to do well.",2016-01-14 21:16:14
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I think the problem with this course is it was not interesting for me personally. The first two midterms, the concepts were more likable (personally), but once we got into zoology, yeah no. Do the keywords, watch podcasts, DO CROSSWORDS. Good lecturer, boring class and he is condescending so that doesn't help. Best of luck!",2016-01-10 20:16:02
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Not as bad as people say he is. Don't ask questions if he already said it. Entertaining classes. Great lecturer. Watch the podcasts, don't rely on them.

Textbook is not very useful but can be.",2016-01-09 22:14:04
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Anything he mentions in class is fair game for midterms/finals. Is intimidating and gets annoyed easily when you ask questions, so I'd suggest referring to the text first if you can. GREAT lecturer though; very easy to understand. For keywords, focus on the crosswords and words related to those; don't just memorize each keyword individually.",2016-01-07 11:16:35

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Dr Houseman's lectures were long but they could be interesting if you stay focused. Take notes for every single sentence he says in his lectures since his exams are basely mainly on what he talks about in class and the keywords/crosswords. Don't waste your money on the textbooks; you can get an A+ without them as long as you attend the lectures.,2016-01-05 20:45:21
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman is a great lecturer, but is so cynical. Don't ask him a question in class or he'll make fun of you. He's a hard prof and is so picky when it comes to writing answers, but if you have to take him then make sure you have time to study for his class and prioritize it. If you can take this class in French then do so.",2016-01-05 19:46:13
Jon Houseman,BIO113O,"The man is a brilliant lecturer, however he gets super sassy if you ask stupid questions. If it's not a well thought out Q, he'll just sass you out. His tests were okay, but a lot of the time the definition questions were about things he mentioned like once, briefly in a lecture. On tests do fill in blanks 1st, then MC, then Defs, then Long Answers",2015-12-28 21:51:56
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Let's settle in and start this review. Houseman is a great lecturer; his class is always interesting to listen to (unless it's the 3 hours on plants). The tests are difficult as there are many keywords to learn and only a few are really tested on in full. The labs for the class are great and they help your average. Best of luck!,2015-12-28 10:58:34
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"You will learn a lot in this class. Do the crosswords (memorize them), do readings if you need  to solidify a concept, look @ old exams b/c he often repeats his mc. Keywords are the stupidest things but you must do them, just to be sure you know them all. He'll give you HUNDREDS for one exam and only test you on like, 5. LOL. Pretty funny though",2015-12-22 18:41:11
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Bad power points, often unclear, a total ass when people ask questions, likes making questions about seemingly minor concepts. Pretty impossible to do well but if you want to try - do readings before class, do the keywords, rewatch podcasts, start studying ages before the exam. Messed up marking scheme, hard exams-@ least he bell curves. AVOID!!!!",2015-12-21 17:12:04
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Awful,  no matter how long you study for get ready to fail. Tests are based on the most unrelevant keywords. Lecture notes are very unclear, his powerpoint are pictures and you have to do your own research. There are a million key words that he expects you to do. Never want to have another course with him.",2015-12-21 15:51:53
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Lots of material was covered. Found that memorization was valued over understanding (though he says otherwise). Make sure you do the crosswords! At least 20 pts of each test are drawn from them,  word for word.",2015-12-19 21:55:02
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Memorize his crosswords, they're given marks. Don't expect to get any marks for definitions or long answer questions unless you used the exact words he was looking for. Don't ask questions or answer questions in class, he's a good lecturer but he's mean and will put you down. He thinks he's above everyone...",2015-12-19 15:14:02
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Keys to A+: 1. Completely dissect his podcasts and take notes on EVERY detail 2. Memorize those notes 3. Do crosswords (free marks!) 4. Look at keywords to make sure you know them all, but DO NOT waste time writing notes for them. Everyone studies differently, but there's a very specific way to succeed w/ Houseman and this is what worked for me.",2015-12-18 16:35:29
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I found Jon Houseman to be a great lecturer. His course covers a lot of material, but he conveys it well and is a very captivating speaker. I found the lectures very interesting. The exams are tough though. There is always a couple curveballs on them. Also, don't buy his book Digital Diversity. Waste of money, never opened it once. ",2015-12-13 09:32:11
Jon Houseman,BIO113O,Hardest prof. I really tried for this class and didn't do very well. Brought down my average a lot but I guess that's what is expected first year. He really likes the subject but calls out people a lot. Be aware. And studying 20 hours isn't gonna get you the marks you have to be a genius!,2015-12-11 19:51:39
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman provides excellent tools to ensure that you can learn the material. Lectures are recorded online, and he gives crosswords and summaries as well as textbook readings. The amount of material is huge but if you put enough work in, it's doable. Houseman can often be condescending, but the course is mandatory.",2015-12-04 17:37:11

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Honestly if you want to do good in his class, watch the podcasts and take detailed notes as if you are writing a script. Memorize these notes. Also do the cross words!! You can pass the midterms by just doing the crosswords alone. Find as much previous midterms as you can and do those questions, since he reuses them  ",2015-11-29 11:23:08
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Good lecturer. You must study off of what he says in class so take really good notes. Terrible human. Not approachable and very impersonal. ,2015-11-15 17:36:28
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Honestly the hardest cause I've taken in university, he gives an unbelievable amount of key words which are not of any use as the exam questions are centred around very specific details which only had one slide and maybe 1 minute of lecture time on. Good luck.",2015-11-11 21:42:13
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's my favourite prof in my first semester of university. He's a great lecturer, but incredibly hard marker. Be ready to study and memorize.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He's a great lecturer and he knows his stuff. But the class is very difficult for a first year class. Don't take it as an elective for the love of all that is good. Do the crosswords and try to understand all the key terms if you want to do well.,2015-10-04 18:41:51

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"It's not that he's tough, it's more that there's a lot of material to cover. You NEED to keep up with and review everything in a timely fashion. The little details matter.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Treat the details of the course content like you would when reading a novel, it's much easier that way to retain information and to really understand keywords.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Take detailed notes (word per word) on what he says in class. His marking scheme is pretty tough. Be ready to memorize. I didn't make a keywords  list but rather studied the material like a story. good lecturer though! ,2015-08-02 12:20:35
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I think that his terrible personality is what I disliked most about him. He is cold, sarcastic, and has humiliated people in front of the class before if they did not use the quieter door to enter the lecture hall (especially if late to class in doing so). The 2 midterms and exam were not as difficult as they were vague in the questions they asked.",2015-06-18 11:49:08
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He integrates student comments and short videos to make lectures more interesting. He's a good lecturer but a brutal marker. He will call you out on your stupidity if you answer a question stupidly and the only person that enjoys the course content is Houseman himself. He makes you buy Digidiv which is an online site for 2nd half and it's trash.,2015-06-15 23:28:12

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I have a lovehate thing with this prof. His exams are marked very harshly but if you study properly you should do well!

Unless you have houseman's brain OR happen to be a mind reader OR just-so-happen to study the questions he asks, you will do terribly on that section.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Okay lets get settled in, get started. Houseman has a lot of rumours surrounding him but he is a good guy. It is crystal clear how hard his course is and he tells you in his course guide. A word of caution, key words are only part of the deal. You need to read and re-watch his lectures because otherwise you will suffer. Enough Said. ",2015-01-12 13:01:52
Jon Houseman,BIO1330,Extremely ambiguous exams and midterms. Almost as if expected to mind read what he wants you to say. The lectures are very clear and podcasts are always available. ( Beware of times where he shuts off the recording to mess with people that don't show up to class) Make sure you read the webpages on each of the lectures thoroughly!,2015-01-09 12:56:11
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Is in love with himself and his own voice. Labs and homework are easy. Hard marker as he is very specific, and there is a large volume of material in the course to cover and it's not clear what and what not is important. It defaults to 'everything I say is important'.   Podcasts are the most useful. Passing the class is not too hard. ",2015-01-09 12:53:34
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is an amazing lecturer, but his midterms and final are brutal. Do not focus on the keywords, but make sure you do the crosswords, it will help you on the fill-in-the-blank. Almost all of the answers to his assignments are online. Go over the podcasts and remember to work smart, not hard!",2015-01-06 01:21:37
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Brutal marker, unless you can read his mind you will get no marks on short answer, so to do well you need to get every multiple choice and fill in the blank correct. ",2015-01-05 20:44:16
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Amazing lecturer! However, he is not very helpful outside class. Fill in the blanks are taken from his Crosswords. Keywords help with definitions but DON'T FOCUS ON IT; they're NOT everything. Focus instead on making sense of all the info given to you; organize them into your head like one big story; this will definitely help for long answers",2015-01-05 19:18:07
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Interesting class but he acts like a jerk when people ask questions and promotes himself too much. Incredibly tough marker, you have to get the precise words he wants or you get zero. Labs and assignments are easy but tests are tough. Wouldn't recommend.",2015-01-05 18:40:39
Jon Houseman,1130,"Worst prof ever. If you want help from him, forget it. Very unreasonable. If you don't have that one word in a question that he wants you will get a 0. ",2015-01-05 15:03:29
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Terrible marking scheme !!!!!!  He only looks for specific word and it doesn't not matter if you have explained it and wrote as much as you could to clear your point. He searches for that specific stupid word! ,2015-01-05 00:14:46
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Yes, Houseman is a tough grader and his marking scheme is extremely specific BUT he is a phenomenal lecturer and will teach you 95% of what you need in class.  Tips to succeed: make notes primarily from the podcastslectures, do crosswords a couple times (free marks!), and only do the keywords that you don't know. ",2015-01-04 22:02:01
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I generally have a good memory and can memorize lots and I've heard that this class was all memorization. Houseman goes into so much detail on so many things and only tests us on a small portion of the material and expects us to remember it all. There were also over 400 key words on the final (which wasn't cumulative),2015-01-04 21:45:52
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He's not as bad as people claim. Yea he;s tough with his midterms and exams but if you really make good use of all the resources he gives you and actually put in the effort for the big work load, then a good mark is manageable! focusing on HIS explanations for key concepts worked best for me since he basically decides what the ""correct"" answer is. ",2015-01-04 17:25:43
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Yes, what everyone says is true. Houseman is TOUGH. However, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Split your keywords up with friends, do the crosswords, fill in your notes with the podcasts and you'll be fine. This class is a lot of work, and the final is definitely overwhelming so do well on your labs, midterms and assignments. ",2014-12-22 13:10:03
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,he is a big no no but you have no choice because he is the only one who teaches this course. Most pickiest and toughest marker! Go to his lectures and listen to his prodcasts BUT google and yahoo answers helped me out way more than he did so don't depend on his ridiculous digital diversity and dont memorize the key words understand his lectures!!! ,2014-12-19 21:57:37
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The material is really interesting, but his class made me dislike bio. I really liked biology in high school. He is rude and it seems like he is constantly trying to promote himself and how ""great"" he is. The tests are somewhat fair but he only accepts answers if they're worded EXACTLY how he'd word them. ",2014-12-17 13:16:47
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"In the past I've had teachers who I didn't learn a ton from during class, so I was ready. However, it seems like its really difficult to do that, since there aren't a ton of clear resources you can use. Considering how huge the textbook is, I was hoping it'd be more resourceful, and his book, 'digi div', which he just promotes like a new mix tape.",2014-12-16 20:08:26
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I have never in my life felt like such a failure. He's very rude and don't try to ask him a question cuz he will make fun of you. Don't take this class unless you have to. Too much material try your best on labs and assignments. You have to basically speak ""his language"" or you fail, if you don't write exactly what he THINKS is right,then its wrong",2014-12-16 12:17:09
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"First thing: this guy is an ass. He will cut you off midsentence to make fun of you. Next, he really knows what he is talking about. Good lectures. But that doesn't really matter, he is incredibly unclear as to what he wants you to know, and if on tests you have a right answer but not his, you get no points.",2014-12-16 08:29:35
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Although the course seems alright at first, it becomes increasingly difficult. Midterms are primarily based of his online crossword puzzles rather than the lectures... HE is extremely difficult to understand in terms of language use. No direction, and a lot of information to know. Good luck to anyone who has to take this his course... ",2014-12-15 16:47:12
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Do well on  midterms and labs cause there is way too much information to study for the final which he does not even mention in his lectures. Don't take this class if  you are not required to,2014-12-15 14:19:10
Jon Houseman,1130,"Incredible amount of material to memorize. It's more like two courses in one and the last bit is huge, so huge that he can't get through it all in class. All part of their plan to fail as many people as possible. Worst course ever so take it elsewhere if you can. Believe the rumours. It is just plain awful and not worth the unnecessary stress.  ",2014-12-15 10:48:41
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is an ok lecturer who gives you the slideshows to annotate beforehand, the issue being that anything out of his mouth is considered testable, yet at least half of the exam content has never been touched in class. Need to work through the mountain of readings and keywords  crosswords to hope to pass this very information dense class.",2014-12-14 19:39:47
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"It's hard to study for this course because he dumbs everything down so much during the lecture, but expects so much on the tests. The marking scheme is ridiculously specific, and part marks are difficult to get. He's super sassy. ",2014-12-12 21:02:46
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is proud to show people that he is smarter then you. Doesnt give part mark, he want a perfect answer. Usually the highest range of grade is E and F. But, he like to take these two category out to do the class average, so it's not under 55%. wouldnt take that class if it wasn't needed.",2014-12-11 15:45:34
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Dr. Houseman gives interesting lectures, although they feel long. He is well organized and gives decent feedback, even though he is a hard (but fair) marker. He really wants students to succeed and is interested in good teaching methods and suggests many different methods for studying including vocab lists with crosswords and interactive diagrams.",2014-12-09 16:38:22
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"The rumours are true! He is indeed a tough grader. If you do not like organismal bio, you won't be liking this course one bit. The labs help boast your grade, and he does bell curve the midterms. He gives lots of resources (if you have the time) to do well. He is funny during the lectures but a little intimidating outside of class.",2014-12-07 00:47:09
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Might as well get settled in and get started on this review. Great lecturer. but very long as well. Main issue is with his tests. The questions themselves are very fair, but his marking scheme is too specific for an information based course. Even if the answer is correct, if it was not in his marking scheme, you won't get any marks for it.",2014-12-04 19:31:55
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"- Gives Great Lectures, be prepared to type notes.  - Midterms are challenging, multiple choice is pretty much eenie-meenie-miney-mo game - Don't bother asking him for help, he won't even look at you or cut you off mid-sentence to make fun of you - Grading is horrible, expect B.S points taken off - keywordscrosswords help - Not recommended ",2014-12-03 10:37:32
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Like any first year class, you'll need to do a lot of adjusting. My advice, try to go to every lecture, go over each podcast a couple of times before the midterm and screw the keywords. Unless you plan on staying ontop of it the whole semester and splitting it up, just give up and memorize the crosswords. ",2014-12-02 21:08:39

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Like any Science course you will have to work for a good grade but all tests and exams are fair despite the large amount if content. Not an extremely approachable professor but not bad to speak to one on one when you have a specific question.,2014-11-24 12:01:14
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"YOU WILL NOT PASS THIS COURSE IF ALL YOU DO IS GO TO CLASS AND READ THROUGH YOUR LECTURE NOTES. HOUSEMAN IS A HORRIBLE PROF. HIS MARKING SCHEMES ARE VERY SPECIFIC.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman, without a doubt, is a great speaker; however, the content on the exams, and his marking schemes, are unfair.

You'll have to memorize all keywords and read the online notes and the ones you made in class and do the crosswords and glance at the extra resources he throws at you.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,A true intellectual. An amazing lecturer and educator. Other professors should attend his class to see what impeccable teaching looks like.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Great lecturer with a dry sense of humour who really knows what he's talking about. I liked him! Condescending on occasion (okay, most of the time), but as long as you don't ask stupid questions and use the resources he gives you, BIO1130 is not THAT bad. The midterms do focus on very specific things, however, so start early and memorize!",2012-12-24 16:06:25
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Good lecturer. Yes, there's a ton of material, but there's nothing on the exam he didn't cover in a lecture UNLESS it's on a crossword. I've never seen a keyword on the exams that he didn't go over in class. Do the crosswords, and memorize the keywords he expounded on in class (and make your definitions using your class notes), and you'll do fine.",2012-12-22 22:46:15
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Probably the best lecturer I will ever have; really knows his stuff. You may think the course content is easy, but make sure you know everything before the exams.

Marking scheme is VERY rigid, don't be surprised if you do poorly on them.",2012-12-21 20:37:48
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Houseman is extremely knowledgeable, and very passionate about what he teaches. He is one of the best lecturers I have had in my four years at uO.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Although his midterms are tough, he does give a fairly large amount of hints for them. After the first midterm you will learn how to study for his tests.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,He was very interesting and knowledgable. The course is easy to get a good mark in as long as you take good notes in class and do the crosswords he posts online.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Some good qualities as a prof (good explanations, online resources), but many bad qualities.

Jon Houseman,BIOB,Very interesting guy and he honestly seems to have the students interest at heart when it comes to learning the material but his exams are pretty hard. Mostly study what he just briefly goes over in class cause chances are that's what will be on the exam. and the keywords and crosswords are really helpful.,2012-12-10 13:04:11
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,I'd be more interested in this course in 20 years when the material is more absolute.He tells you exactly what you need to do to succeed and gave us generous bell curves on both of the midterms. Look at the past midterms because a fair amount is recycled from year to year. I liked the Dr. Houseman but not the course.,2012-12-07 17:07:23
Jon Houseman,BIOC,"Expects you to know to know so much material but only tests you on a select few things..problem is, you don't know what those things will be so you just have to try and study everything which can be overwhelming.

Very rigid with marks.",2012-01-10 21:42:34
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is the BEST prof, really cares about the class and tries to make it interesting (little jokes, sarcastic comments and videos).

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,Have a look at the keywords before each lecture and look out for them in the lectures. Go to class!! Then make time to watch the podcasts and write EVERY word he says. Even if it's listening to the podcasts on the bus while reading over his blurbs do some bio every school day. He makes bio enjoyable but make no mistake this is NOT a bird course.,2011-12-28 13:34:37
Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Amazing lecturer. Go to class, don't skip because podcasts are online- use them as a study tool.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"A great professor. Dr. Houseman's lectures are great, very interesting and funny. He can be intimidating and demeaning when students ask questions in class though.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"I found professor Houseman to be a good educator. I found his voice clear and his lectures interesting, most of the time.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"He is an excellent professor. I don't know why he got a lot of bad ratings.

Jon Houseman,BIO1130,"Interesting lectures and provides many resources. However, like others have said, his midterms can be difficult and based on memorizing facts, no thinking required.

Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,I really appreciated how she opened home studies and options to FaceTime her for extra office hours. We had a few study sessions at her house.

Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,"Lots of students like to complain about Aziz on the subreddit but Paula is on a whole other level. Refuses to answer emails, teach, or mark.

Paula Sauveur,GNG4170,I'd say the only reason her rating is this high is because you're not allowed to give a rating of 0. Only graded on three things throughout the course.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,Decent prof! His midterms and final were very fair. You don't need to attend lectures (although they are helpful) just read the textbook extensively and do practice questions. He's also nice albeit dry. He gets bad reviews but he was actually pretty good and very fair,2021-01-15 04:11:42
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Took a course shared between him and Prof Gray. Prof Lenjosek's lectures can be dry, but you'll get used to it. Never interacted with him outside of class. No posted PowerPoint slides because someone was selling them for money. If you're fine without the slides, he's a decent Econ prof with fair exam questions and good knowledge.",2021-01-14 16:22:31
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"Hands down the worst professor I have ever had. It is difficult to ask him questions because he is extremely rude. Super unclear with his feedback and his midterms and impossible to finish in an ""attempt to reduce cheating"", but then said people did too well and lowered their marks with no actual proof. Avoid at all costs",2021-01-08 17:10:39

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Try to avoid this professor in the future. The quality of the lectures is not high, and there is little after-class help communication. The practice questions and the weekly QUIZ are almost inconsistent with the content of the midterm exam. The content of the study differs greatly from the content of the exam. So all of this leads to a lot of stude",2020-12-18 06:32:14
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,"He was never available outside of class and whenever you would go to him or email him, he would give you a short aggressive answer.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"He is very knowledgeable on the subject and explains the material very well, providing many examples. An assignment is due every week that helps you understand the chapter better and gives you the ability to practice. Exams are average, really depends how comfortable you are with the subject. People skills could be better but overall good prof.",2020-12-13 19:06:41
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"What kind of prof takes 10+ points (2 letter grades) off the class midterm grades 3 days before the final exam? Unfair grading scheme.

You couldnt pay me to take class with him again.",2020-12-13 14:14:14

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"With Gray & Lenjosek. Was incredibly stale. Every lecture was prerecorded. Nothing stands out with Lenjosek whatsoever. Weekly connect assignments are easy, I got a 97% without studying. The exam can replace the two midterms to be worth up to 80% of the final mark. The textbook is a must.",2020-12-12 03:14:34
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"This is coming from an econ major with a 9.5GPA who loves their field... this was the worst class Ive ever taken. Final exam was near impossible.

TAs were nice tho",2020-12-11 15:35:17
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Weekly assignments are given and not very difficult as you are able to complete them twice for a higher grade, but aren't related to the midterms. Midterms are basically designed to make you fail. The workload wasn't crazy but the mid-terms were awful. Surprised if anyone got a good mark on them. Avoid this prof if you can.",2020-12-10 04:06:51
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"He drops your grade because he does not think you can get it, my mark of midterm 2 went down 15% because he said it was impossible to get that high without cheating.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"The midterm, the second one specifically, were unfairly hard to the point that over 200 kids have failed it and he refused to curve it and kept the average at a D+.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,Wasn't helpful when I reached out for help. Don't give any extra assignments to help raise your grade and overall doesn't seem to care about his students.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2145,"This prof is rude and snarky. He doesn't seem to care whether his students succeed or not.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Getting past his humour, I thought his teaching was stimulating. I have another class with him and am genuinely looking forward to it. His exams are verbatim what he teaches in his lectures and what you attain from reading the textbook. If you study, you'll do great.",2020-05-15 01:35:07
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Very dry humor, very difficult to sit through an entire lecture listening to him. He gives way to long of midterm exams for the short period we are allowed to complete it, so even if you are comfortable with the material, you will feel rushed on all exams. Highly recommend avoiding him if possible",2020-05-09 14:56:20
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Initially had my worries about Lenjosek based off of the reviews on here. In short, he's a pretty decent guy, he cracks some jokes here and there and tries his best to make a dry subject entertaining. With the transition to distant learning, he has gone above and beyond to help the class. Go to lectures, take decent notes, read chapter summaries.",2020-05-04 05:08:16
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Boring. Very boring to listen to, and the content is easy enough to self-teach. Just do the reading from the textbook, and check the slides.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,Horrible professor who does not care at all about his students or their mental health. Very disappointing of uOttawa to hire someone who is so blatantly against what they claim to stand for. Would give a zero if I could.,2020-04-19 20:36:43
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"Worst prof I've ever had a class with. His lectures are boring and his slides make no sense and are very unhelpful.

I definitely would never take a class with this prof again.",2020-04-18 22:28:14
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"I like his teaching style, but the final exam was a nightmare. There were short answers while the other sections had all MC & it mainly covered chapter 18 & 19 which were the most difficult & not explained as thoroughly as the others.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2118,"He can be rude sometimes which makes it difficult to ask questions in class. Going to class feels useless sometimes because he mainly reads off slides.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,He is very good at explaining concepts and his slides are well done but he is the hardest of 1st year micro and macro profs at OttawaU and it is very difficult to get an A or higher.  He also is very strict but was helpful during office hours explaining concepts.  If you want to learn lots I would take him but if you want a good mark you shouldn't,2017-01-12 17:59:33
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,"I took both macro and micro from professor Lenjosek and fr they were the hardest thing I've ever learn. I'm not saying they were just hard, of course i've learned stuff that was much harder than economics but he made it way harder and boring. no offense but i think economics is quite boring by itself and honestly he made it to another level.",2017-01-06 13:53:38
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"he gives tough love. Dont ask silly questions because he gets annoyed about it when students do that. In his class, you really do need to work hard to get a considerably good grade, like, you actually need to put a lot of effort into his class compared to other classes. Economic is quite dry ,he does try to make his slides more interesting, still..",2016-12-29 19:04:15
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"he is an average professor, decent at best. The material is not difficult and you dont have to attend class really, you can just learn it on your own from the textbook. Midterms are fair, although very few MC's are almost impossible to know the answer for. I would take him again he is very average but definitely a rude professor.",2016-12-23 17:22:08
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Gordon Lenjosek is a unique prof in the sense his classes are a hit or miss.  One class might be good, the next your board and waiting for it to end.  Gives a practice midterm/exam to do before the real deal which is very helpful as they closely reflect each other.  Not very enthusiastic but lectures are effective.  Overall, decent but not bad",2016-12-14 22:02:56
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Basically rereads you the textbook during lectures, which makes the class dull especially in the later chapters.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"While I did generally enjoy the material studied, I did not enjoy having Gordon Lenjosek as a prof.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Lectures: Straightforward and clear (enough that you don't really need the textbook). Makes sure you understand the content and allows questions.

Only thing you need",2016-12-07 21:08:59
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2111,"This is my second time having Gordon (the first time I had him for MACRO I). I actually really liked him in this class.

I am going to miss this prof!",2016-12-06 21:55:10
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102B,He gets confused often when teaching the class and doesn't seem to know his slides very well. The midterms are way more difficult than the practice midterms and quizzes. Definitely would not take his class again.,2016-11-18 10:04:10
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,He's funny at times and you can get 20% from aplia which is incredibly easy with the textbook next to you. He won't even count your 2 lowest scores on aplia if u do all of them (1/week). His lectures do feel long sometimes because of him or the course and he takes nearly everything directly from the tb which makes studying easy but lectures boring.,2016-10-12 17:33:10
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"Excellent Prof!  If you show up to class, read the chapters, work through the problems, you will do very well in his class.

Work hard and go in there knowing that it won't be easy, but it's not because Lenjosek makes it that way, it's really just the material being inherently difficult at first. ",2015-10-02 00:39:02
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2142,"Only did this at the end of the semester but read the lectures before going to class. Try and figure out the content before you get to lecture.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,He made the class interesting and fun and always answered any student questions during class. I didn't need to use the textbook but studied from his power point slides notes.  His testsexam exactly followed his outline and class notes. Lots of material covered during lectures but saves time from having to read the book. Take good notes in class.,2015-05-25 18:13:58
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"He believes he's smarter than everybody else but, ironically, he's not good at explaining the subject.

Always willing to answer my questions.",2015-05-07 13:29:31

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Do not recommend at all. Laughed at people in the class when they asked questions regarding the exam, or any questions for that matter.

Expectations were not realistic for first year intro to macro students",2015-04-21 11:01:44
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1104,"Not the best prof Ive had, went to seek help from him on many occasions and each time he speeds past what hes explaining and makes the concepts more confusing.  I would say he has unrealistic expectations for the class for the difficulty of the midterms and final exam. Worked real hard in this class and it was the lowest mark of all my classes.",2015-04-19 19:21:16
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Lenjosek's most redeeming quality is his clarity and his lecture notes. You know what to do and what to expect. Other than that, the general consensus seems to think he is arrogant with a personality that is hard to relate to and his sense of humour suggests he got bullied growing up. Read the textbook, study the slides, and watch youtube videos!",2015-04-19 14:01:16

Wouldn't fully recommend though.",2015-04-17 00:04:01
Gordon Lenjosek,ECO2144,"I liked his intro to macro, and decided to follow him. However, his lecture notes in macro theory are really dispersed.

Gordon Lenjosek,ECO1102,"Likes to make obscure acronyms for words. Instead of calling 'exports' like 'EX' or something he calls it DPGSB (domestically produced goods sold abroad) makes things more confusing. Also writes formulas that don't make sense. ex: equity  assets - liabilities BUT assets  liabilities. Laughs at students who ask questions, seems angry if questioned",2015-03-21 13:47:36

You have to construct all the content to study yourself based on her vague lectures which have no actual content.,2018-03-18 22:57:37
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,My midterm is on Tuesday and I still don't know what to study.,2018-03-18 22:25:11
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She uses Active Learning in her lectures. Much time is wasted on each slide, as she asks the class questions to prompt her to expand on the slide, yet changes her explanation multiple times to fill up class time. Each Active Learning question puts about 6 minutes of break time in the class, which is her way of filling up the lecture class time.",2018-03-18 19:29:04
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Makes life difficult for no reason. IDK why she's the only professor for the course. UOttawa needs to get it together.,2018-03-18 15:13:43
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Probably the worst prof I've ever had. Her ""teaching"" style is basically making you read the textbook and then asking students in class to explain the concepts themselves instead of going into detail herself. Barely any of the readings assigned correspond to her lecture material and her exams are wayyy too hard. I would avoid her at all costs.",2018-03-15 19:37:04
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Her course is the main reason that made me switch from biology! Awful prof, the worst ever. Students shouldnt be experimental subjects for your Active Learning researches!",2018-03-15 09:33:37
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"When she is lecturing, if you listen very carefully to what she is saying, she is repeating the same concept over and over again but rewording it (which confuses the students because they think it is a new thing but it isn't!). The result of her repeating everything ends up taking her 30 min to finish 1 slide when it could have been done in 10 min.",2018-03-07 22:51:08
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,she uses an 'active learning style' that other profs don't use. But there's a reason other profs do things differently; her students leave her class confused and feeling like it was a waste of time. She should teach instead of asking her students questions and then not telling us the right answer! May as well just teach yourself from the textbook.,2018-03-07 00:23:35
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Throughout history, it's been the tradition that the student learns from the teacher as it pertains to gaining knowledge. Unfortunately, an ideal comparison to the student-teacher interaction in this course is lagging Wi-Fi connection. Hard to follow in class, and not to mention bad marking schemes. Which makes for passing the torch impossible.",2018-03-03 20:01:46
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Dr. Turcotte is great as a person. With that being said, she is just brutal on exams. I honestly think that she is taking away the beauty of biology for most students. Hopefully, uOttawa will decide something soon as courses like these are what make people avoid studying here.",2018-03-02 20:32:35

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Shame on the University of Ottawa for turning a blind eye to the current situation with this professor. It is not fair for the students to be paying thousands of dollars in tuition to receive a prof who is entitled and unfair towards the students. She is very rude and creates the midterm in a way to make you fail miserably on purpose.,2018-02-25 02:50:29

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I have no idea how she is allowed to teach. She is the worst professor I ever had and will ever have. She treats us like 5 year olds in class, skims the surface of a very challenging topic, and then makes us go teach the rest ourselves.

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,She is the worst prof I've ever had. Doesn't teach any concepts properly and then screws u for it on the exams. You have to literally write exactly on what SHE thinks is right. I don't get how this school has made her the ONLY prof for this mandatory course. I would drop my degree if I have to take her again. She is the worst part about uottawa.,2018-02-03 03:01:07
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"I would tell you to avoid this prof, but unfortunately she is the ONLY one who teaches it so buckle up your seat belts and get ready to SUFFER. She thinks she is doing you a favour with active learning, but I'd beg to differ. If you don't do the readings honestly gl, she barely lectures. I pity all y'all who gotta take this course.",2018-01-25 21:51:54
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"""get ready to read"" is an understatement. You will have to teach yourself every single concept and do so much work outside of the lecture.

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1109,"She gives good (recorded) lectures. She does her best to keep the students active in class. She also effectively makes any topic interesting.

She is an overall good professor and I enjoyed my time in her class.",2017-12-26 11:35:25
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Instead of lecturing, she gets you to learn the material from her readings that are very difficult to understand, and then spends the class doing application questions.

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"She says that readings are mandatory, but they really aren't. I got an A+ in this class without EVER doing the assigned readings or watching the assigned videos. She only grades on the information she talks about in class and on her slides. For midterms and exams, she barely changes them year after year.",2017-09-04 19:27:36
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"SO many readings, and they don't make sense, don't bother with them. Her lectures are not really lectures and a lot of waiting around for people to answer questions under the assumption that people did the readings. You don't really need to go to lectures because she uploads the videos online, just study from the lectures and you should be fine.",2017-08-09 09:17:19
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Probably  one of the worst  professors I have ever had. She takes a simple introductory class and complicates It way more than necessary.

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"At the beginning of the semester she'll make you believe that her class is going to be better than normal lectures. It isn't, it is much worse. She really can't teach and her exams are ridiculous. You might think you did ok on an exam and your answer might be right but if it doesn't fit her bizarre marking scheme, too bad. AVOID and save your GPA",2017-06-15 23:50:16
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"In general, don't bother with the readings unless she specifically tells you that a portion will be on the midterm.

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Ok, so she was awful I'm sure you've gathered that. But I beg you if you must take this course; the readings DO NOT matter.

Best of luck.",2017-05-11 03:24:10
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"For this class, all you need to do is watch the podcasts. Pre-class readings? - a whole bunch of stuff maybe helpful during the class, but not in the exams.

Everything she needs you to know is what she says in class, in the podcast!!",2017-05-10 13:00:25
Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,"Dr. Petit-Turcotte is actually not a bad professor. She makes the effort to provide all the resources needed to succeed in the course.

Caroline Petit-Turcotte,BIO1140,Honestly I've never had a worse professor. Her marking scheme is ridiculously unfair and she does not prepare you for midterms or final exams.

Diane Pacom,SOC4703,"This teacher is all about show. She LOVES to talk about how great she is, very cocky. Her discussions & course content were extremely interesting though. Personally, I found the class very interesting, but as a teacher, she is very unprofessional & rude. The things I've heard her say to some students are unreal. If you can put up with it try it out",2013-06-28 11:18:50

Diane Pacom,SOC2700,"GREAT teacher! She adores teaching and it shows. One of the very few teachers who actually cares whether you learn or not.

Diane Pacom,SOC2700,"Extremely good prof, explains very well, cares about her students, makes funny jokes, relates pass to present, gives plenty of examples to undertand, speaks many languages. The only negative I can think of is: a LOT of reading to do (books you choose: usually 600 pages +, and what her ASST. gives you to read which are long articles). But worth it!",2006-11-01 11:29:12

Diane Pacom,SOC2700,"First of all, a 3M award does not mean much. But mostly, I have to say that she is NOT recognized by her peers at all. This professor is all about appearance and pleasing the students. Serious students who want some content, and who want to further their knowledge should avoid this teacher. She is funny though, but University is not Comedy Club",2006-09-07 14:42:02
Diane Pacom,SOC,"Interesting...Some students left negative and sarcastic comments.  This is a ""3M"" award winning professor, the highest recognition available in Canada for professors/pedagogs.  She speaks several languages, is recognized by peers internationally, cares about students, etc.  I cannot but wonder about acumen of those that write negatively.  A fan.",2006-02-12 19:14:03
Diane Pacom,SOC,"Excelent teacher! One of the best. Unlike other sociologie classes, this one forces you to analyze society. Most classes i've had just tell you what other people (most dead long ago) think. She tells you what she thinks and then with the help of other theories explains it and adapts it to what's going on now. Plus she makes it simple.",2005-10-25 19:38:28
Diane Pacom,SOC,"She was the best teacher I've had in University so far. She encourages you to go all the way in school and loves students.  She doesn't make you buy expensive books that you will never ever read again, she cares about the student which is really hard to find in teachers now of days",2005-08-15 12:53:34

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Highly recommend taking ITI1120 with Prof. Vida. I learned a ton of concepts in a short amount of time due to her amazing lectures and difficult assignments. Sometimes coding can be frustrating and you may be on the verge of giving up, but if you can absorb all material in this class properly, you'll become a much more proficient coder.",2022-05-01 17:19:47
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,Amazing prof if you are just getting started in programming. She clearly explains each topic and helps you in clearing your concepts. Her teaching style is very unique and makes you grasp stuff really quickly.,2022-04-29 01:44:23
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Very great Prof, ITI 1120 is super easy and they gave tons of resouces to help students succeed. ",2022-03-28 17:34:28
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,She goes into clear detail when teaching Python and even speaks on the importance of coding in the future. You can tell she hopes for her students' success while also being realistic about their success. Switch to be in her class and you won't regret it.,2022-01-11 20:33:10
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,AVOID HERE IF YOU NEVER CODE .. the class is okay for people who already know how to code but if you don't definitely learn in advance and do some projects. cause this prof does not teach you anything she will expect you learn from tough assignments.,2022-01-10 16:56:47
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Assignments are hard, but tests are relatively easier. She is very strict regarding academic integrity. If you cheat, you will get caught for sure. If you study hard, you will get a good grade.",2022-01-07 05:40:26

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"If you come into the class with any programming experience, its an easy A. With that being said Vida is a great prof who cares greatly for both the subject and students. Her lectures are clear and have great explanations with enough examples to get you started. She is tough on academic integrity, but has fair assignments and tests.",2021-12-15 00:14:47
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,She cannot spell correctly in her own tests and she cannot describe clearly what she wants. You will lose a lot of time either trying to understand what she wants or you will lose a lot of time coding the wrong thing because she misspelled it. You are either awarded with a generous 7 minutes extra of time as compensation or none. AVOID THE CLASS!!!,2021-12-09 23:49:10
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Lectures are good, assignments are ridiculous in comparison, but tests and labs were easy. Her assignments and tests are confusing sometimes, but she tries her best to make it as clear as possible. If you've learned coding before, her class is an easy A. If not, good luck, because ITI is going to be a nightmare, and she's the only good professor.",2021-12-08 23:11:40
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Heavy course load and have to put effort into it. Gives 7/14 days to complete assignments and possibilities to ask questions via discussion posts/office hours with TAs. Labs were trash though, my TAs were horrible. Makes it much easier if you know coding beforehand (so you understand the logic of coding)",2021-12-05 18:08:34
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Your marked by output, and her 70 min assignment period timeframe is too stressful to get her tests done and fully have it prepared for all cases. Her writing questions have to be ULTRA specific if not u lose all marks. Most people do well but you need to avoid chegg and know programming beforehand if u wanna have a get above 80",2021-12-01 23:14:51
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Lectures are so easy that even a senile earthworm can understand easily. But assignments and exams are a whole different story.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,Excellent prof.,2021-07-30 08:45:51
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,I absolutely loved this professor. Her assignments seemed hard but were not that hard. Her tests were designed for longer than was given (I need more time to come up with solutions for coding questions). Other than that she is probably the best computer science teacher at UOttawa. Recommend for ITI1120!,2021-06-11 04:02:44
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,AWESOME!,2021-03-06 18:21:05

So, she is a great Professor in uOttawa!!!",2021-01-09 04:33:01
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"I initially took this class as an elective; however, now I am considering a major in computer science. This was my favourite class of the semester. Vida is an amazing professor. I am so glad I took this class with her, and I am sad that this is the only class she teaches. I highly, highly recommend her!!!!",2021-01-06 16:21:43
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Professor Dujmovic cared a lot about her students and taught the course well enough for a beginner to understand. If you started out not knowing anything about Python, you could still receive an A+ because of her natural ability to teach. Her assignments may be a little long but they are usually fun and great for preparing for tests and learning.",2021-01-06 14:16:12
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Having Professor Vida Dujmovic as one of my first professors at UOttawa was a blessing.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"At first, you will think her assignments are hard and you don't want to take this course anymore.

If you watch lectures and complete/understand assignments, you will do well in exams",2020-12-16 18:15:13
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"The textbook is provided, I did not use it very often. Her lecture is both clear whether you got in touch with programming or not.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,Vida is a really good prof and makes learning python pretty interesting. She was very organized and her forums in the coursepage was very helpful.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,Vida is not a hard prof at all; it's the subject matter that is hard. She is great at explaining.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1121,Her lectures are very easy to follow and they're all recorded. Just do the work and review the lectures and you'll do fine. Make sure you know exactly what's happening in your code step by step and do all the Coursera work because that's what the exams are like.,2016-03-11 22:54:26
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Vida is the best professor I ever had. Please , just take ITI courses with her ! She did her lecture by showing how to write code from scratch and she will explain every syntax that she used. You will know how good she is when you take ITI 1121 with another professor",2016-02-01 00:44:49
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Amazing prof! All of her lectures are recorded and she goes through everything step by step in front of you so it's easy to follow.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Great prof, assignments were manageable, just beware of the midterm and the exam, they are multiple choice and easy, but it is also very easy to get mixed up between answers. So as long as you know what you're doing it's fine. She is very clear in her lectures, so it shouldn't be a problem in understanding concepts! Take her class if you can",2016-01-21 03:04:31
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,Dr. Dujmovic is fantastic. I cannot say enough good things about her lectures and her support for students outside of class via BlackBoard.   She is organized; she gives multiple examples; she reviews tricky concepts before exams; and she's funny. I hope to take a course taught by her again in the future.,2016-01-14 19:17:37

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,One of the best profs I've ever had. I had never programmed before but found her teaching very easy to follow. Her course was also very organized. She had lots of office hours and ran on online discussion forum where you could get help. Her assignments were quite long though. This course is not overly difficult but requires you to put effort in.,2016-01-12 17:46:02

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Vida is a good teacher that explains er lectures very well. The DGD's are long, but it has a variety of exercice that we can do. There is a lot of office hours during the week, which allows student's to go ask questions when they're available. Overall, the teacher was positive which made it fun to learn.",2016-01-06 14:47:01
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Dr. Dujmovic is one of the best professors I've ever had on the criteria of listening to a student's questions, and offering an answer that is both pertinent and informative regarding the nature of the question, and doing so in a manner that is neither handing students the ""correct"" answer, nor is it diminutive of the student's uncertainties.",2015-12-18 19:19:10
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,I had no previous experience with programming and didn't have to much trouble with the assignments and usually felt quite confident. Didn't do as well as I'd liked on my midterm but Vida was happy to help me to understand where I went wrong during her office hour. Key to passing is reading the textbook and doing as many practice programs you can ,2015-12-16 10:13:50
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Vida is an excellent programming prof. If you don't know the language being taught, you should attend all lectures and ask any questions you have, as she always monitors her online forum through blackboard. An easy A if you already know the language, just make sure you're familiar with recursion and string/list operations.",2015-12-03 20:39:14
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1101,"She definitely know's her stuff, but assumes the students do too. Unless you have previous experience with coding, she is very difficult to follow.",2015-11-25 13:33:42
Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,Assignments can be tough without programming experience but they're doable. Midterms are tricky because she doesn't do much to prepare us. Make sure to do the Coursera work before the midterms and understand the exact definition and outputs of everything without testing it the code. That's the only way you'll be ok on the exams. ,2015-11-12 13:21:51
Vida Dujmovic,CSI5127,She is the best professor I've ever seen in uOttawa.,2015-06-04 19:28:38

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,this course can be hard if you do not have previous programming experience. I came to the class with no clue how to even create a simple program.

Vida Dujmovic,ITI1120,"Ok teacher. Lectures are ok-ish, but assignments are perfect practice and she gives you tons of time to do them.  She's not very good at answering questions, but the TA's in the labs usually can clear up any questions you have.    You either ""get"" programming, or you don't. ",2014-12-09 14:23:18
Vida Dujmovic,ITI11200,"Great prof for introduction to Java.  Only thing is sometimes she skips steps leaving you lost for the rest of the lecture, although she will answer any questions with pleasure.  This class is very hard to take notes in, as she has prewritten code that she explains most of the time.  Assignments can be tricky, but theres an online forum she hosts",2014-11-27 22:18:29

Safaa Bedawi,CSI2110,Prof. Safaa is amazing. She is always willing to help students outside class and her lectures are easy to comprehend and enjoyable. She made the quizzes/assignments interesting and all of her TA's were fantastic and super helpful. I loved attending all her classes. The only complaint I have is the labs were slightly confusing towards the end.,2022-08-17 03:24:03

Safaa Bedawi,CSI3120,"Clearly explains concepts and does some live programming. The class is partly programming in OCaml, with some theoretical topics as well. Overall not too difficult and I enjoyed learning OCaml and using it to solve the assignments.",2022-05-15 18:27:17
Safaa Bedawi,CSI3120,"I took her for the prerequisite class for this as well. She is a down-to-earth teacher who does a serviceable job at teaching some alien programming concepts (Like prolog), she mostly just read and went through notes that were already prepped by another prof. That's not a bad thing given that you can only learn the course content through practice.",2022-05-03 22:02:07
Safaa Bedawi,CSI2120,"Bedawi's lectures are pretty enjoyable. The content is tough, but I feel I finished the course with a deep understanding of the material. Course had a pretty difficult project, but grading was lenient in the end. Maybe the only problem with this course was the amount of time spent on difficult concepts was less than there should have been.",2022-05-02 15:08:45
Safaa Bedawi,CSI2120,Overall a great professor who clearly cares about her students. She conveys material quite efficiently. No surprises on the exam. The assignments were the right level of difficulty. You will not struggle if you have her as your professor and work hard to understand the languages.,2022-04-29 19:22:50
Safaa Bedawi,CSI2120,Professor Bedawi is amazing. This is my second class with her and she always ready to help out students. She really cares about the students and she is open to any suggestions that will help us thought out the course. The course was challenging but she tried her best to accommodate us. I would definitely recommend her.,2022-03-25 15:47:24

Safaa Bedawi,CSI3120,"I'm so grateful that Safaa taught me both CSI2120 and now CSI3120. She is the sweetest professor and is very knowledgeable.

Safaa Bedawi,CSI3120,"One of the best prof I've had with. She explains things clearly step by step. No bs in lectures, straight into business. Exams are reasonable and easy if you watch her lectures. Way much better than Amy Felty who also teaches this course.",2021-10-23 04:24:19
Safaa Bedawi,CSI2120,"I really enjoyed taking this class with Prof. Bedawi. There was no midterm for this course but to make up for that there was a ridiculous amount of assignments which took a while to complete. That said, the grading on the work was very easy. She also gave a lot of opportunities to earn extra credit through bonuses and quizzes.",2021-08-10 22:30:07
Safaa Bedawi,CSI2110,"I am so glad that I have prof Bedawi teaching this class. I made sure to attend all her lectures because her explanations and examples were very helpful. Unlike some profs she doesn't just read the slides, she really explains things and encourages questions and participation. Always accessible outside class and overall just a solid prof!",2020-04-28 15:21:20
Safaa Bedawi,CSI2110,She is one of the best profs I have ever had at uottawa. She is very clear about what she expects from students. She is very kind and understanding. The midterm was long but not hard at all and her lectures are very clear.,2020-04-05 21:04:45
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"He talks a lot about himself, (which is fine), but it can get kind of weird and excessive. He will not return your grades until you have graduated. It took him 3 months to return the midterm mark. It has been a month since the final, and only half the marks have been received and uploaded.",2022-05-16 02:00:10
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,Taking prof Mulveys class is a pure enjoyment because he is such a good storyteller. It took me two months to realise that I was taking a university class instead of a reality tv show. The course deliverables are decent and clear if you pay attention to the class. Take this prof for consumer behaviour and you will not regret it.,2021-11-01 23:36:16
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"It is undeniable that the prof is a humorous and cool guy, but the lectures are oversimplified and abstract. He also asks you to read the textbook in advance so that he can skip all the content from the book and jump to his ""Life Lessons and let's watch a clip"". If you wish to learn something useful, then this might not be the right class for you.",2021-09-18 11:56:13
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"This poor excuse of a prof doesn't even hand back the grades. Even in class, he doesn't actually teach, just talks about his life really. Single handedly one of the worst here at Telfer. Doesn't give grades back or too lazy. Give us the grade for the first research challenge back man it's been a full month already and it's a small assignment too.",2021-06-10 22:30:25
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"Unless this class is mandatory to you, I would not recommend taking this course as an elective since it demands a lot of your time due to heavy workload.

This class also involves heavy group work, so your grades are burnt if dunces r in a group.",2021-05-21 06:58:18
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"This course alone has the workload of three classes. Although Professor Mulvey was really good at lecturing, his course deliverables were so complex and tough to finish. Unless this is a compulsory course, I will not suggest taking it, at least not this prof. Exams felt like that I was doing a MBA instead of a BCom degree. Save yourself and RUN!",2021-02-10 18:44:00
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"Prof Mulvey while good at lecturing, thinks that this is the only course you are enrolled in. 20-30 min interview and write a 2 pg 1x spaced reflection on this interview, FOR 10%! equivalent 4-6 pg 2x spaced. I have a higher year course, which is asking, read an article and respond in 2-3 pg 2x spaced, for 15%! Prof, I have other courses too.",2021-02-01 03:22:16
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,"Hilarious guy, but not a good teacher; spends more time goofing off and talking about his life growing up than explaining course materials. Has weekly ""dojo challenges"" that start the first week; even though the deadline to switch into class is 3 weeks after; he won't allow you to make up for the ones missed if you switched. Easy enough marker tho",2020-12-24 09:11:58

He is very lazy: he doesn't respond to emails, is painfully slow to grade assignments, doesn't provide materials in a timely fashion, and his examples & slides are dated by 10-25 years.

Also he should put up his slides before class so students can take notes on them.,2004-11-07 17:52:04
Michael Mulvey,ADM3321,This is by far the best reacher i've had in university. This si the first class that i've actually done more work than required because it is so interesting. This man can tell a story like no one else. If you have the chance to take a class with him do it,2004-10-06 23:22:57
Michael Mulvey,ADM2320,Has high standards. Not a course for slackers.,2004-09-28 14:01:46
Michael Mulvey,ADM2320,"Great lectures--can make the most boring and trivial marketing concepts seem exciting.  Personable and funny, an excellent educator all around.",2004-03-28 13:47:53
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2304,Professor Quadir consistently goes the extra mile for students in his great preparation of materials and examples. He does the job extremely well and I am so fortunate to have him as my teacher for Stats 2. I strongly recommend taking Statistics courses with him.,2023-03-11 01:56:30
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2304,"Professor Tanvir really tries to make sure students do well in his class. He uploaded videos and resources such as assignment/test guides which showed how to complete the work properly. He also was always accessible via email, after class and office hours for questions. I will never take a stats class again but if I had to it would be with Tanvir!",2023-01-11 22:26:22
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2304,His assignment basically give you answers meaning they should be easy. 4/6 Mc quizzes 5Q each are an easy 10% if you attend class. Midterms and Final are pretty much answers that are given in his study review session. He shows the type of qs how to approach the q and the criteria on how they grade the questions. He is a great prof. Don't avoid. ,2023-01-07 22:56:33
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"Great prof for intro to stats. Go to class/watch the lectures, do the homework, and textbook learning checks, they cover exactly what you need to know. Very reasonable guy. I never asked him questions in class, but he was always willing to answer questions during the 10 minute break in class. Oh also, class ends 10-30 minutes sometimes.",2023-01-07 19:40:51
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"Not a single negative thing to say about this dude. Does a phenomenal job explaining concepts, his midterms are super easy, and his exams are a little on the tough side. He has a bit of an accent which makes it difficult to hear sometimes but he makes it up for it by making sure all his students learn and understand concepts thoroughly.",2022-12-14 18:53:24
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"Honestly, very fair professor, teaches very well, super nice and understanding, as long as you process the lectures and do a little bit of practice, you will do amazing.",2022-12-04 23:50:56
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"Super helpful prof, many evaluations and resources so you can practice.  I didn't go to class, just read the textbook, practiced the exercices, and watched the recordings he posts if I felt I needed clarification.  Hate math and I enjoyed this stats class. Great textbook, very clear grading guidelines. It's clear he wants students to succeed. 10/10",2022-10-13 13:13:45
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2304,"Very caring professor which will make recordings of the in-person lectures for students to review.

Tanvir Quadir,PSY2106,"He is someone who cares about the success of his students. His lectures are fast-paced, but if you pay attention and take notes, you'll find that he explains the content very well. His courses are planned well, and he provides practice questions with answers for each chapter.",2022-01-19 22:58:10
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2303,Amazing prof! Clear explanations and lectures.. responds very fast to emails and always goes through the assignment questions in lectures and explains how to solve them Lots of practice problems and review material to prep for exams. Exams are fair imo (some hard questions here and there but overall no surprises) without too many surprises,2022-01-13 18:59:28
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2303,"Take this course with this professor. always there to help with the assignments which are worth a good deal combined so go to office hours and ask him questions after the lectures. Attend any exam review sessions the ones he hosts will help you lots. Great professor who cares a lot about the students in his class, probably the best one to take.",2022-01-04 14:37:40

Tanvir Quadir,PSY2116,Honestly I love stats and Professor Tanvir is a good professor but because of the asynchronous lectures I just felt like I was teaching myself. Also 80% of his test questions are found online or on Chegg.,2021-11-01 23:39:44
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2116,"after doing really well in stats I, i thought this class would be a breeze - the prof, unfortunately, just didn't work for me. he was persistently late to class, went over the allotted time, and wasn't very clear on content that probably could have been better taught with a textbook. the workload was also heavy: 3 quizzes, 2 assignments, 2 tests",2021-05-04 19:09:59
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2106,"his teaching style didn't really work for me, I like having a full picture of what it is that I'm doing, and a lot of the time I felt confused in this class. His assignments and quizzes are pretty fair and well-composed. I also like the quizzes on Brightspace because they allow me to make sure I'm on track. He also provides a formula sheet.",2021-05-04 03:25:17
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2116,"He's a really amazing stats prof! The bad ratings don't do him justice as the only reason he goes over sometimes is to make sure you understand the content! Like if you don't want that, just leave the lecture. He goes out of his way to help you, especially with assignments, and all his grading is very fair. 100% recommend!",2021-04-21 23:32:00
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2116,"I loved 2106 and was excited for stats but then I took this class. Although easy, the classes are so hard to pay attention to. I was so reliant on the TA. The lectures made me want to sleep. I felt like all of the quizzes were very different from what was learned in class and the practice questions. Get any other prof if you can!",2021-04-20 18:40:34
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2116,"This is so frustrating, as he is extremely disorganized. He goes way too fast and his problems usually aren't clear/miss information. This just adds more confusion to the content. He also sometimes seems like he's fed up when you ask him an ""easy"" question.",2021-02-10 02:41:46
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2116,"I don't doubt Tanvir is great in other courses but DO NOT take him for PSY2116. I thought it wouldn't be too bad considering the prof I had for 2106 but I was wrong. I cannot pay attention to lectures, I don't know what to write down, he goes so fast but slow at the same time. His classes bordered on 1h40 on average. Do not take for online PSY2116",2021-02-06 22:26:22
Tanvir Quadir,PSY2106,"Loved this teacher. Stats is so heavy and although his lectures were long and sorta monotone, if you really pay attention and take notes your bound to get a good mark. He provides practice questions every chapter and ""PDQ"" sheets (like a memory aid that you can use during tests and exam). Awesome teacher highly recommend if you're scared of stats.",2021-02-05 03:05:14
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"Professor Quadir is one of the best professors I've ever had! He cares about his students deeply and wants them to succeed. His explanations were AMAZING, he talks slowly and makes sure to really engrave the concept in your brain. 10/10 would recommend you take his class if you're not the best at math because he will simplify everything.",2021-01-21 20:35:57
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"Love this man. The lectures were a little boring, I always had to put them on 2x speed. However, he is such a nice person. His tests are easy. He really cares about his students and wants us to succeed. He even compared the two classes and realized the TA messed up and compensated us, which never happens btw. Hes a gem.",2021-01-14 01:25:04
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"This prof always put in a lot of effort to help students fully understand concepts and evaluations. Definitely cares about his students' success. I found the lectures to be slightly boring, but it is math after all. Overall you can't go wrong with this prof he's very good.",2021-01-13 16:08:32
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"i wish all profs were like him. genuinely cares about his students and his organization and effort shows. dedicates so much time, will answer all your questions, and guide you step by step through assignments. more content heavy than the other profs, but def more worth it bc u actually learn material. go to his lectures!!! pace & clarity is insane",2021-01-12 19:01:48
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,"This guy was hands down my favourite professor during the semester. He went out of his way to make sure every single detail of the assignments he gave was understood, and made sure to answer every question that was asked. You can tell he truly does care for the success of his students, and if you dont do well, thats definitely on you.",2020-12-09 17:40:57
Tanvir Quadir,HSS2381,One of the best professors I've had so far. He takes so much time to actually help students out with assignments and concepts before the exam. He wants to make sure we understand and do well which is very much appreciated. Definitely would take his class again.,2020-11-28 02:39:37

Tanvir Quadir,ADM2304,Professor Quadir is one of the most caring profs I have ever had. He is very accessible after class and he really cares about his students! His in-class quizzes are fairly simple and he provides very clear expectations when it comes to his assignments. Would love to have him again!,2020-04-06 21:23:28
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2304,"This Prof made the harder of the two stats classes a lot more bearable. Went out of his way to ensure all necessary content was provided on the slides.

No suprises on the midterm, and assignments/quizzes are an easy A.",2020-04-05 21:00:05
Tanvir Quadir,ADM2303,"Being in his class is great he explains everything you need to know very well. He is always willing to help out his students.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"His lectures are based entirely on the textbook so make sure you have it, and read the assigned chapters twice over before each exam for a guaranteed A. Exams were all multiple choice which I appreciated, but each midterm is 25% and the final is 50% so keep that in mind. The final is pretty easy if you read the textbook and takes under an hour.",2023-02-09 14:40:59
Victor Emerson,2174,He has a lot of interesting stories that he shares the whole class. He then makes you feel bad for asking questions and then gets mad and makes you feel stupid for asking them. Avoid,2023-01-19 01:26:48
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"Took as an elective. Funniest prof I had last semester. All you need to pass, is to read the top hat textbook a couple times and answer the questions in there. He tells really awesome stories and loves to bike lol. Read the textbook chapter before class so you can focus on the hints he gives you for your MidTerm and Final. Would def take again!",2023-01-15 04:25:58
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"You definitely do need a textbook for this class, all of his lectures are directly from the textbook. His lectures aren't too bad, very simple and straight to the point and he really does help you go through and explain the textbook. He also has some pretty good stories that for once actually do have to do with the class. Overall not too bad.",2023-01-09 19:44:01
Victor Emerson,PSY2174,"AVOID. Makes you feel stupid. Insanely hard marker. Doesn't give clear instructions for assignments, then takes off SO many marks.

Course content is easy though. ",2022-12-28 18:09:22
Victor Emerson,PSY2174,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF (I don't have enough space to write it all) 
- Made this simple class way to hard
- Unclear instructions (if any) 
- Really hard grader

- Lectures we disorganized 
- Got mad about all the emails asking for our marks on our final assignment so he didn't give them back till after the exam 

",2022-12-19 18:01:28
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,Great course - and all of the questions on exams are right out of tophat. He gives really engaging lectures and often tells us funny or inspiring stories about himself. Only downside is that he can be kind of grinchy or unresponsive by email but tbh just ask him in person and he's quite professional then.,2022-12-16 02:25:23
Victor Emerson,PSY2106,"A good teacher who wants students to succeed. Sometimes grumpy but loves questions and really wants to help. I would recommend reading the chapters and doing a few problems before class. Then the lecture makes it all make sense. Finish the problems in the textbook after class, practice using the formulas, and you will do well. ",2022-12-04 18:37:09
Victor Emerson,PSY2106,"Surprised that he has so many good reviews. Really nice guy, bad prof for PSY2106. 3 exams, no chances to bring up your grade. Lectures fast, classes would last 20-30 minutes. Promises formula sheets, and doesn't give them.  Others who are taking the same class with a different prof are offered cheat sheets, and we were not allowed anything. ",2022-11-29 14:04:18

Victor Emerson,PSY2174,Sends lots of passive aggressive emails. Makes you feel like an idiot. Incredibly tough marker BUT gives really poor outlines on what you are meant to be doing. No rubrics for assignments either. (If the entire class did poorly on an assignment maybe it's not just the students at fault? Just a thought.) Chicken scratch handwriting.,2022-11-14 15:34:04
Victor Emerson,PSY2174,avoid at all costs. no instructions what so ever on assignments and then wonders why students are failing but does nothing to fix it. though grader and good luck understanding his feedback. also makes very inappropriate comments. ,2022-10-18 16:39:38
Victor Emerson,2174,He is literally so vague. He gives 0 instruction. His lecture contain 0 info. He is also inappropriate at times. AVOID AT ALL COSTS,2022-10-11 18:35:49
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,Great professor in my opinion. If you just read the TopHat textbook and did the midterms you would be fine. Attendance was apparently mandatory but it was essentially the same thing as reading the textbook except he would explain it in his own words and make it more understandable. Lectures were long but worth going if you could. def would take agn,2022-08-27 04:36:03
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,I didn't attend the lectures and simply read the textbooks and got an A+ by doing so. You just have to make sure that you memorize and review well and you're on your way to an A+!,2022-05-03 16:28:55
Victor Emerson,PSY2116,His style of teaching statistics was not what I was expecting (more theory-based than actual calculations) but overall he was a great professor. He was super responsive to my emails and made himself available outside of class within reason. He also provided a lot of opportunities for students to ask questions. Don't bother with the textbook though,2022-05-02 16:47:24
Victor Emerson,PSY2116,"If you have the choice I would not choose Victor Emerson as your statistics teacher. A statistics teacher who can barely do the bare minimum to provide for his students. In my opinion, he should retire and become a comedian, his whole class is a joke. ",2022-04-22 15:22:02
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"He is a kind professor, I did mostly use the textbook instead of attending lectures since all quizzes were based solely on the interactive textbook.

Victor Emerson,PSY3108,"Most unclear grading criteria I have ever seen. He does not answer emails, or if he does it takes a long time for him to get to them. He expects you to gather additional information and not ""simply answer the question"" but at an unreasonable scale. He will not offer feedback because he won't let you see your test... Makes this class too difficult.",2022-01-11 05:24:19
Victor Emerson,PSY3108,"This prof is very organized and seems fair with his grading. Theres quite a bit of material, but you only need to read the textbook based on whats presented in class.

Victor Emerson,PSY2116,"Dr. Emerson really ""dumbs down"" the material and makes statistics really simple to understand.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"Prof Emerson is a great guy. He really tries to make the class interesting! The lectures aren't necessary, but I always went because I really liked him. The textbook is a must to read and study because the exams are based on it not the profs lectures.",2020-11-20 01:34:02
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"Very intelligent professor, has lots of excellent stories and great taste in music! He includes useful examples from his personal life and years of experience to illustrate the concepts.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"20/10 professor. I'm a 4th year student and took this course as an elective. Very entertaining lectures. Probably the most well spoken Professor I have ever had. Very smart man and seems to genuinely care. Makes all of the classes interesting, no matter the content. I highly recommend. Tests are directly related to the course material.",2020-06-08 21:40:57
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"His lectures are way too boring to attend, goes excruciatingly slow and tediously emphasizes points that are pretty trivial. Basic textbook course so all exams were based directly from book, buy it, read it, ace the class. The notes you make yourself from the book are prolly more aesthetic and clear than his. Not a BAD prof, just boring and slow.",2020-05-11 21:40:44
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"I thought Prof. Emerson did a great job at conveying the 1102 material in an interesting way, and did a good job at trying to include relevant examples of his own with the textbook material for it to be easier to remember.

Victor Emerson,PSY2116,"Professor Emerson does a great job of explaining statistics in a way that can be understood in everyday contexts.

At the same time, expectations are clear - so if you do the tutorials you will be okay.",2020-03-23 11:13:11
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"Emerson's slides were detailed and are a good summary of the textbook. I definitely recommend taking a class with him.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"I actually liked the guy, he's really passionate about teaching and loves what he teaches. Midterms are tricky but manageable.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,Very funny and wise man. Favourite prof i've had in university thus far. You don't have to show up to any lectures to do well in the class because the exams are based entirely off of the textbook and he posts all of the slides summarizing the book on brightspace. I still showed up to class simply because I enjoy hearing him lecture.,2019-12-08 03:26:52
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"He talks about his life for 60% of the class, which is kind of interesting but not relevant to the course. You have to read the textbook if you want to do well.

Would've rather taken with another prof :/",2019-04-18 19:48:14
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"The course material is based in the text, so just read it.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,You can skip every class (minus the mid-terms) and only read the textbook and emerge with a good grade. The class doesn't really do much for you besides give you an opportunity to ask questions. He often ends classes early and I wouldn't recommend his 3 hour lectures (they'll kill you). He often gets off topic and tells many personal stories.,2018-06-14 19:35:39
Victor Emerson,PSY4130,Overall not too bad a prof. Wasn't a fan of how almost every class was spent talking about really random stuff that we were never tested on or required to write papers about. He obviously loves to teach because he is 70 and still going strong. Very intelligent man. Loved having one on one conversations with him during office hours.,2018-05-09 22:32:09
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,Very dull prof. Never went to a class after the first midterm because he talked about his own stories more than the course content. Finished with an A+ regardless. Just read the textbook and enhance that material with his slides and you'll pass easily.,2018-05-06 09:59:03
Victor Emerson,PSY2106,Explained stats so well that I already understood the concepts in the second stats class by the time this course was over. Very helpful during office hours and the exams get easier as the semester goes on,2018-04-23 09:59:02
Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"Victor Emerson is such a loveable guy! He actually gives you really good hints on what material will be focused more on the midterms and exam if you go to the lectures, and he usually gives a 10 min break every hour and we end by 9:30, which is chill.

Victor Emerson,PSY2116,"AMAZING Prof!! He made stats enjoyable, believe me! Sticks around after class and gives you feedback and goes above and beyond to make sure his students understand the material for the tests. 4 tests and a final, no assignments.

Victor Emerson,PSY2106,"Professor Emerson is very funny and he's in general a kind man. What i also liked about him is that he would consider the marks you get on the two midterms and assign the heavier weight to the one you did better on. However, sometimes it would be difficult to understand/hear what he is saying. He LOVES when people ask questions. He will pick on you",2016-01-07 19:11:41
Victor Emerson,PSY2174,"I guess I just disagree with the general consensus. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, actually felt like he went super slow before exams to force people to try.

Would definitely take him again :) ",2015-06-18 15:22:23
Victor Emerson,PSY2174,Had him for stats and research. He spent an entire class going over the midterm. If you did better on the final he made your midterm worth 10% instead.

Victor Emerson,PSY1102,"Funny guy. Makes lectures as interesting as the material allows, and is always open to comments or ideas to improve his teaching. Enjoys teaching and is very knowledgeable. Definitely a good prof - would recommend! Exams can be tricky, as the wording is quite specific and can change the meaning ever so slightly. Be careful and you should be fine.",2012-04-01 12:04:15
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Prof. McKenna is by far and away the worst prof I've had so far. He was rude to students who emailed him with questions. Fully ignored the bio component of bioethics, so if you looking to take a philosophy class he's your guy. His TAs marks harshly and doesnt respond well to feedback. Also, he offered us a chance for extra credit and never gave it",2022-12-15 05:04:05
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"He just rambles on for the whole class and leaves it to the students to have an open discussion, which I suppose makes sense for a philosophy teacher, but most of the people who take this class are enrolled in a science program, so this kind of format is unfamiliar. Midterm poorly reflected the ""lecture content"", but the papers were graded fairly. ",2022-06-27 14:55:11
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"This class certainly had the potential to be interesting, but it was not. I did not learn a thing about bioethics. The textbook used was a pure ethics textbook and did not relate to bioethics. His expectations are extremely unclear for tests and papers. The live classes had no structure. By the end of the semester he became really rude. ",2022-05-16 13:56:08
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Very nice person but his course was a MESS. Lectures were one long rambling convrsation, with unclear connections to class content. Midterm was super hard and did not relate to what he taught. Almost never at his office hrs (held an O.H. while he was out on a run) and would reply to emails a week later. Provided bonus mrk assignment which was nice.",2022-05-15 17:53:14
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Midterm was tricky. Expectations unclear. Opportunities for bonus marks exist, but they're time-consuming. Near the end of the term, he was more impatient answering questions, which made the final exam all the more difficult and bothersome to complete. Just do everything you can to take bioethics with a diff prof. ",2022-05-13 14:26:38
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"He really got rude in the end in my opinion. At first he showed so much empathy and patience and understanding of a student, but as soon as that final came he got aggressive in his tone he used with us. No need to embarrass and ridicule students in front of a whole class and the blame of organization with bonus points is a you problem, not us Dr.M.",2022-05-10 21:48:23
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,Very unclear with instructions for the position paper. The midterm was extremely hard and did not care. Hard to watch lectures.,2022-05-05 19:13:29
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,BEWARE of this prof! Never answers emails and hangs up on you after two minutes during office hours because there are too many students.  The grading is extremely harsh on papers and doesn't even make sense. Instructions are unclear for everything. His midterm had so many questions on it that were not covered. Textbook and lectures are useless.,2022-05-04 20:10:28
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"This is the worst course I've ever taken thanks to McK*nna. He didn't provide any instructions for the position paper or final exam. He didn't post the rubric for the final exam until 2 days before it was due, leaving many students confused and unsure of his expectations. He also tells his TAs to be super harsh with grading (according to a TA).",2022-05-04 17:24:21
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"This class was so unnecessarily difficult. The prof went on long tangents during class time - completely unrelated to class content. He did not prepare us for the one midterm, gave no guidance for the exams and paper and was unreachable by email. Instructions are so unclear and it's not like he does anything to help. Terrible class. Do not take. ",2022-05-04 01:15:07
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"After we had our midterm in Feb, his lectures became unstructured. Going to class a waste of my time. The only reason I didn't drop the course was because it was mandatory. If you like a strucutred class with clear instructions and helpful material, do yourself a favor and take another prof. DON'T TAKE HIM AT ALL COSTS!!! ",2022-04-10 03:06:47
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,His class is not structured - it's just him going on long rants and tangents (2+ hours sometimes) that aren't at all useful to learning the course material. His multiple choice exams were unnecessarily difficult. Oh and he wants us to write questions for him to use in his test bank next year... does this not count as slavery?,2022-03-05 03:59:49
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,If this class wasn't mandatory I would have dropped it. The textbook was so poorly written and not relevant to bioethics - it was ridiculous. Lectures are not structured and half the time we don't even talk about the material. He seems like a nice person but I disliked his class so much. Assignment instructions left me confused all the time.,2022-03-01 20:03:33
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Took him during covid 19. Honestly, he has a good heart, but the way he taught in this pandemic was not for me. He made breakout rooms constantly which did not help me. He has flexibility with deadlines but is not clear with what he wants for is case study assignments. I would not take his class again",2021-04-06 17:57:18
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Very good prof! Considerate that we have other classes and always willing to extend deadlines. He brought different headphones, laptops, routers, etc. to try and make his zoom classes the best he could even with poor internet. Small assignments/quizzes due every week that are an easy 30%, a midterm, case study, and a final (case study)",2020-12-14 21:31:38
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,Made zoom classes interesting and he showed us his chickens. Gotta do all the readings or else don't expect a very high grade. Overall an easy course but get ready do have small assignments/quiz every week. (This class is online during corona so idk how his classes are in person),2020-10-20 03:41:53
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Didn't like his bioethics class. We had concepts on the first midterm that were never assigned. Not very clear expectations. Overall, this course was poorly organized.",2020-01-14 05:20:32
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,This guy's so funny and probably the realest prof I've ever had. Bioethics was super interesting but you gotta do all the readings (can be very dry) and participate in class to make the most of it. He's really good at leading discussions and gets you to think critically about ethical issues. Got 100% on the take-home final which was a case study.,2020-01-06 16:01:36
Iain McKenna,PHI2398,Boring material. Useless slides. Lots of reading. Very easy midterms if you do reading - mc and short answers. Participation is free 10%. Final is take-home paper that was easy but haven't received marks yet.,2020-01-02 00:53:55
Iain McKenna,PHI2398,"He was probably good in the past, but he was the worst this year.",2019-11-22 18:22:10
Iain McKenna,APA3301,"Amazing professor, he made ethics interesting. Would 100% take a class with him again!!",2019-03-03 15:41:44
Iain McKenna,ECH2310,"Great prof! Very entertaining, loves class discussions. Midterms and final are very fair. Readings can be intense but he explains them well.",2018-12-21 23:45:24
Iain McKenna,ECH2310,Hilarious prof. Super charismatic and interesting. Midterms and final are all set up the same way. Really takes students' ideas into account.,2018-12-12 12:42:27
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Iain Mckenna has to be by far my favourite prof at uOttawa, his lectures are so interesting and he is so funny but yet such a down to earth prof.",2018-07-03 22:20:15
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,McKenna is a solid choice for bioethics. He asks us what to put on the exam and loves in-class debates. Made the course so much easier than it would've been. Keep being a gem McKenna,2018-04-20 03:45:16
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,"Professor McKenna is amazing, he cares about what he teaches and makes it interesting.",2018-03-20 20:40:50
Iain McKenna,PHI2396,Love this professor! His lectures are so interesting and the topics are never ever dull! He is also very sweet and cares for his students,2018-01-12 22:10:51
Iain McKenna,PHI2398,"He's a really fun prof. The discussions were great and the guy is mad smart. Tests were chill, but there's A LOT of reading. However, he doesn't test the details too much, just understand the concepts, keep up with the chapters and you're gold.",2017-12-25 15:17:43
Iain McKenna,ECH3330,"Prof McKenna was outstanding. He treats students like equals, talks rather than lectures, and still gets the course content across fantastically. He brought in some of the most interesting guest speakers I've ever experienced from a variety of fields. Readings were pretty compulsory but the textbook reads very easily. Would definitely take again.",2017-05-29 19:13:56
Iain McKenna,PHI2398,great prof!,2017-03-27 11:52:42
Iain McKenna,PHI2397,"Professor McKenna was a great professor, almost missed him, got lucky for having him in PHI2397.",2017-01-30 13:40:23
Iain McKenna,PHI2397,Very straightforward professor. He provides us questions on the midterm/final beforehand and will not trick you. The final consisted of essay questions but he allowed us to bring in cheat sheets and expected us to basically write the essays at home first then rewrite it in the final room.,2017-01-04 17:09:35
Iain McKenna,PHI2397,You have to read a chapter each week and write a quick summary for participation marks. You didn't really have to attend since he posted the slides on BlackBoard. Overall his test were very straightforward (gave us the question in advance) but the exam required a lot of preparation. Overall a nice prof that understands students.,2016-12-12 11:14:41
Iain McKenna,PAP4355,"In most of his classes, you submit a one page summary every class of the readings. He makes his expectations exceptionally clear. He is a dynamic lecturer, and a fantastic professor!",2016-09-21 13:06:07
Iain McKenna,PAP4355,Very personable prof. Cares about his students and does not shy away from thoughtful conversations. I took his Ethics class so perhaps that catered more towards participatory classes but still interesting. There were assignments to be handed in before each class which counted as participation points and there was group presentations. Good prof!,2016-08-30 17:03:17
Iain McKenna,CDN1000WB,"Pretty simple class with an interactive component. Has the difficulty of a high school course, so I couldn't worry about consulting the professor for help. He seemed pretty available from the multitude of emails he would send out.",2016-07-17 15:45:04
Iain McKenna,CDN1100,"His personality is simply amazing! Although a lot of reading is required, but he will give you the questions before the exams to prepare, so it's pretty fair. AMAZING CLASS:)",2015-12-16 15:56:52
Iain McKenna,CDN1100,"Super cool prof. Rocks all kinds of bow ties. Great sense of humour. He is always ready to help out his students in every way possible and is always open to ideas from his students. That being said, expect A LOT of work and reading in this course. The course content is pretty dry (especially if you don't like politics) and lectures can be long.",2015-12-10 12:33:50
Iain McKenna,POL4187,"Great professor and great class. He's very open to suggestions and is flexible with deadlines. He's also knowledgeable in this subject and makes it interesting. This class is mostly a big discussion group on different topics of ethics in IR, so make sure to read the book. Not a lot of assignments, but participation is important. ",2014-12-11 23:18:54
Iain McKenna,CMN4105,"Okay, seriously he is the best prof I have EVER had. He's open to dialogue about projects, clear in course requirements, and he treats you like an equal instead of a lowly student. He values students' input and collaborates with to be fair about the course material; yet he's not a pushover. Reasonable, and gave an extension for the final. A+ prof.",2014-04-07 19:37:53
Iain McKenna,CMN4105,"Professor McKenna is a class act.  His teaching is fun and engaging.   He is very democratic,  allowing students to decide on projects and grading schemes.   I liked his approach to classroom discussion.  I would highly recommend him and his excellent bowties.",2014-04-03 23:03:56
Iain McKenna,CMN4105,"Professor McKenna is a class act.  He teaches very democratically, responds quickly to e-mails and is a really cool guy in general.  He engages the class, even if the subject is initially foreign to you.   He rocks bow ties.  I would highly recommend him.",2014-04-03 22:56:38
Iain McKenna,CMN4105,Hands down the best professor I've had at this university. He makes you really think about why you have specific opinions. You learn a lot and delve into a lot of philosophy in an applicable way. Really recommend this to anyone who likes a looser class structure and a lot of discussion.,2014-04-03 14:03:42
Iain McKenna,POL3171,"awesome prof!! I highly recommend taking his course. He truly cares about his students and actually makes class fun and interesting! Not to mention he's hilarious! If you put the effort in, you will do well! You get exam questions before hand and also allowed a cheat cheat on exams",2014-01-14 22:46:56
Iain McKenna,CDN1000WB,Great prof. Interesting class. Responded to his emails quickly and very clear with what he wants from his students. I had problems with technical difficulties at times and he is very understanding with his students.,2013-09-12 12:40:36
Iain McKenna,CDN1100WB,"Great Course. Appropriate work load. Loved the different assignment styles-I.e xtranormal,merer rant...etc It made the course more fun to learn,which always makes learning easier. I learnt a lot from this course and would recommend it to others. Prof very helpful and got back to me very quickly with answers to my questions. Very interactive course.",2013-06-13 12:28:41
Iain McKenna,CDN1100WB,"My first online course! Very creative prof (creative in that we didn't just have papers due, but video rants, computer animated debates, etc.) The workload was a bit much and I think the assignment weighting was off a bit. But prof is clear and involved and the assignments are directly related to the readings, so it's really really hard to fail.",2013-06-10 07:41:00
Iain McKenna,CAD1100,I put attendance as mandatory because although we never had to meet in person (online course) we did have an assignment due every second night and comments due every night in between assignments on other students work for  participation marks. You can not slack off all week and cram it in on weekends. You must do your homework nightly. Great course,2013-06-08 17:39:02
Iain McKenna,CND1101,"Straight forward course. I think everyone should learn more about the country you are living it. Some of the reading is VERY MIND NUMBING!! It's not the content that's boring, it's the author and their style of writing. I recommend the professor to select more readings from authours like Michael Adams, which I enjoy reading.",2013-06-08 14:39:32
Iain McKenna,CDN1100WB,Great professor! He really wants you to succeed in his class. He effectively communicates his expectations and offers prompt feedback/information :)!,2013-06-07 14:58:21
Iain McKenna,POL3171,Amazing and extremely chill prof who takes students' opinions into consideration. Lectures are like discussion groups and really compliment the textbook.,2013-01-09 21:46:46
Iain McKenna,POL3171,"Funny, witty, super-nerdy smart. Great prof, one of the best at uOttawa. I've had him for 2 classes and in both scored an A but had to work for it - and he is super reasonable. Lets you choose what kind of exam we write (in class or take home). Lets the students be involved in how we are tested. Highly recommended!",2013-01-09 10:08:17
Iain McKenna,CDN1100,Nerdy hot and cares about students.  He gives questions ahead of time and his exams are pretty fair.  Great class!,2012-02-15 20:25:37

Iain McKenna,CDN1100,Interesting class discussions and selected readings are informative. Excellent lectures about selected readings,2011-05-12 11:12:49
Iain McKenna,CDNA,"Had him for intro to Canadian Studies.  First off, he looks like Toby McGuire, its so funny.  Couldnt get enough of his class, knows his stuff, and challenges you to think.  Willing to listen to all viewpoints.  Engages his class big time.  Very fair.  I need to retake PHI1101 and I am praying to God that this man is my professor.  Awesome guy!!!!!",2011-04-08 13:28:31
Iain McKenna,CDN1100,He is such a good professor. His lectures are always interesting and he makes an effort to discuss the lectures with the class. He asks the students for exam questions that he uses on the exams. He is very clear and is quick to answer questions. He is a very fair marker and his exams are fairly easy.,2009-12-22 17:08:42
Iain McKenna,PHI1103,"Such a cutie! You can tell he cares about his class, and he really wants them to learn and be interested. I am NOT a huge fan of philosophy, but it was a mandatory course and it ended up being VERY interesting with his teaching techniques. As long as you keep up with the material, you can't do bad in his class! I Definitely recommend him!",2009-08-27 09:30:34
Iain McKenna,PHI1101,Amazing prof. Very interesting and helpful. Take his class!,2009-05-14 22:56:24
Iain McKenna,PHI1103,"very easy course with this teacher! I never read one of the articles and managed to ace the tests. Although he talks way to much and the classes get boring, his use of virtual campus is very very helpful. Pretty much, its obvious he's a nice guy",2009-04-29 18:40:55
Iain McKenna,PHI1103,Prof McKenna was SO adorable!! I will miss his class such a great prof for PHI because he doesn't make the material overwhelming or boring! definately recommend him! He is amazingly sweet too!,2009-04-27 20:07:17

Iain McKenna,PHI1103,"Easy Prof. Great Guy, take his class. The material is whack but if you can memorize the study question answers then you are set because those are what he puts on the midterms and final exam.",2009-04-16 23:40:02

Iain McKenna,PHI1101,"Well the guy knows his stuff for sure. REALLY need to read the book and come to class though. He's good at clarifying, can be really funny at times and seems like an overall nice person. Lectures were dry, I won't lie about that but, that's probably because he talks in a mellow voice sometimes AND the classes were at 8:30. Good prof though!",2009-01-15 13:48:06
Iain McKenna,PHI1101,"Made the mistake of getting behind in lectures and reading: NOT A GOOD IDEA. Was a great prof, very nerdy-hot and extremely insightful. Not good for 8:30 AM classes as some lectures and all slides will put you to sleep on cue.",2009-01-02 02:34:40

Keith McCuaig,MUS2304,"I really don't understand why he has so many poor ratings. His assignments and exams are very clear as to what he's expecting, he's quite specific but as long as you follow his guidelines you won't have a problem. He is one of the nicest profs I've had. All of the poor ratings honestly made me so nervous to take this class but I'm so glad I did. ",2022-05-03 19:37:49

Keith McCuaig,MUS2304,"I really liked this class. The material was really interesting, and the prof conveyed the material very well too.

This class had a midterm, a song analysis, a final paper, and a final exam.",2021-05-05 14:12:03
Keith McCuaig,MUS2304,"The professor himself is fine. Straightforward lectures and responds quickly to emails and accommodation requests. HOWEVER, his TAs mark extremely harshly.

Very limited help whe you go for office hours.  Grading is vary hard because he wants his grade (mean) to be at a certain level with less than 5% of students above 90%.",2017-02-27 20:43:15
Luc Poitras,BCH3756,"I didn't find the prof to be very available at all for questions but the class is very good. I really enjoyed this class and definitely learnt a lot! Grading is tough, but somehow I miraculously pulled off an A-.....",2017-02-23 08:39:14
Luc Poitras,BCH3356,"Lab component was tough, make sure you get a good partner. However, there was only 4 major labs, weekly assignments and a tiny practical midterm. The final was horrible, worst exam I've ever written and I studied a lot. However, Luc gave a generous amount of free percent to the final grade, which helped a lot. Not any easy course by any means.",2017-02-02 17:02:19
Luc Poitras,BCH3756,"The midterm is fair but the final is horrendous. Good thing we are graded by a variety of things such as small presentations, lab book keeping, etc. the labs themselves are phenomenal! Not so in love with the theoretical aspect of this class though.",2017-01-05 17:45:40
Luc Poitras,BCH3356,really super hard final. no thx,2017-01-05 16:53:35
Luc Poitras,BCH3356,"Luc's midterm was pretty straightforward, but his final exam was deadly. The labs weren't too bad, but they were really picky about what they saw in the reports and assignments. Your experience in the course is pretty much based on how chill your TA is and how hard of a marker the TA is who is correcting your assignments/lab reports.",2016-12-15 15:23:29
Luc Poitras,BIO3170,"BIO3170: Notes are pretty clear, everything is there but there a lot to study for. Despite what he says, study everything including examples. Otherwise fair exam. BPS3356: Manual was confusing sometimes, marking scheme for some assignments were ridiculous, and exams were marked for the smallest details. Try to do well on the labs for a good mark.",2016-02-01 18:56:05
Luc Poitras,BIO3170,"Taught the second half of BIO3170 in fall 2015.  In class, it s really confusing, you have to go to him for clarity. He will help you. It was hard to think of the types of questions on the final, uses specific examples in class on final. Did not use Even-skipped this year tho (LOL). Bless.",2016-01-19 18:12:57
Luc Poitras,BCH3170,"HILARIOUS during lectures!! Dr. Poitras is very straightforward when it comes to midterms and finals; everything you need to know is on his slides. If you put in the work , you'll get the mark you deserve.  His office is open almost everyday of the week and he's always willing to help. ",2014-12-31 13:16:51

Luc Poitras,BPS3151,"You don't interact with him much for this course, but he makes the midterms and final exams. He seems like a nice guy if you are talking to him one on one, but he makes one hell of a final exam. The very last question involves material you've seen before, but it is very difficult. If you want a high grade, you should go with the other prof.",2014-06-03 18:38:09
Luc Poitras,BCH3356,Probably one of the best professors so far in my university experience. He gives great feedback and is extremely approachable. If you go to his office he will go above and beyond to help you. The only downside to the lab is if you're unlucky and don't get a good TA,2012-09-06 19:00:45
Luc Poitras,BIO3170,Straightforward chill prof. Just memorize and understand the material and you should be fine. He doesn't give tricky questions.,2012-01-16 23:45:25
Luc Poitras,BCH3356,Great professor and great course. He designed the course so that we actually learn things that are relevant to research for once. The labs were fair and so are the marking. A nice guy too who's willing to help if you have any questions.,2012-01-10 21:17:08
Luc Poitras,BCH3356,"Great lab. All of the assignments had questions about things to be talked about in the formal lab. So if you do your assignments, you have essentially completed 80% of your formal lab. This lab has a lot of down time and if your TA is on top of things, you usually get out 2-3 hours early.",2012-01-08 16:00:01

Luc Poitras,BCH3356,"The course itself is really great. You'll actually learn some useful things in a lab course for once.

Wolfgang Koerner,POL3162,His lectures tend to be extremely dry & boring but his dry humor and his tendency to have shorter lectures can make his lectures easier to deal with. He is a very interesting & knowledgeable person. There are some inconsistencies in grading on papers but that might be the T.A. You can easily get C+ to a B+ with minimal effort,2020-06-20 03:55:45
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"Im surprised by the amount of positive feedback. He basically marks arbitrarily and is hard to come by during his office hours. He cant even justify the grade that someone received which shows that hes an arbitrary marker. Also, his lectures just reiterate what a certain philosopher said.",2020-01-21 19:01:55
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"Great prof, lectures are just him talking at you, but it's fairly easy to grapple with the subject matter. I didn't know we had a textbook until two weeks before the course ended it wasn't really necessary. The assignments are straightforward and relatively easy but you should probably start them a week or two in advance. Overall great experience",2020-01-17 22:58:57
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"Also confused by the amazing ratings on here. I guess it's a preference choice - if you like long lectures with no slides where the prof just reads their notes for an hour, with two evaluations all semester, then that's fine. But he makes no effort to teach other than reading his notes into the abyss, and his TA this semester was extremely rude.",2019-12-31 16:09:20
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"I'm very confused about the positive feedback I've heard from other people on this prof because this was truly the most boring class I've ever taken, which was why I struggled to get a good grade- it was so hard to pay attention in class when I could motivate myself to even go. He reads his notes for the entire lecture.",2019-10-30 03:33:10
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"Do you like taking massive amounts of notes through hard to follow lectures, just to get handed a midterm with 6 poorly designed questions that can be answered in 2 sentences?

Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"He's super sweet and clearly loves the subject he teaches, but he's sooo hard to follow. He doesn't use powerpoints, so ur just following his talking. This wouldn't be that bad if it weren't for the fact that he talks fast, uses lots of big terms, and doesn't repeat anything. The parts of the lecture I DO manage to get down are interesting tho",2019-09-12 20:35:25
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"The best Political Science prof at uOttawa, might honestly be one of the best profs in uOttawa in general.

Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"I took his Intro to Political Thought class in the summer. I suggest sitting in the front because he isnt that loud but he truly knows his stuff and can answer any question being clear. We had a takehome midterm that was 40%, the final was 60%. As long as you come to class and pay attention you should get a A-/A. Amazing and funny prof.",2019-05-08 19:31:17
Wolfgang Koerner,POL3162,"No powerpoints, he just sits there and reads off the material. The only difficulty in this class is typing fast enough to keep up with what he's saying.

Wolfgang Koerner,POL2108,"Outstanding prof. A lot of people skip his lectures - don't. His lectures perfectly prepare you for the final exam. Not to mention, he's a pretty easy marker. Oh, also, he ALWAYS ends class early. Take his class if you can!",2019-04-03 14:19:26

Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"Professor Koerner has a very clear structure of the class. There are two essays and a final, and the essays are easy enough.

Easy A class!",2018-01-19 18:40:40
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"Pretty cool dude. Kinda hard to follow during his lectures because he has a tendency to mumble, but he never went more than two hours into a three-hour night lecture which was awesome.

Wolfgang Koerner,POL3102,"This guys is the best prof out there.  If you go to class and just copy what he says, you'll never have to do a single reading.  Ive had a couple classses with him now and the layout is 2 essays and a final in which he gives you the questions before hand and you get a cheat sheet. Not to mention hes an easy marker and a very witty individual.",2014-01-17 21:51:06
Wolfgang Koerner,POL3102,"Wolfgang is a cool person teaching a boring topic. You have to attend classes because he doesn't do slides or VC but if you attend the lectures and take good notes, you will do fine. He is a pretty easy marker as long as you don't half-ass it. He gives a list of exam questions before the exam so preparation for it is really straightforward.",2014-01-06 09:55:05
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2108,"He does not use virtual campus, so you'll need to attend the lectures. Since you don't really have to do the readings, make sure you listen diligently in class because he goes really fast and can go off topic now and then. Gives you exam questions ahead of time.",2012-05-04 23:41:46
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2101,"Had him for Pol 2101, for some reason i found his lectures interesting, I know most don't, he also seems like he would be a cool guy out of class. However I didn't really learn what I wanted to, I felt it was more of a history class than anything. Also his midterms and exams were all essays, I hated that. Will not take another class.",2011-06-17 14:57:49
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"What a cool guy! His lectures are agonizingly boring.  He doesn't use virtual campus so you do need to attend his lectures, though he doesn't force you to. Very easy to reach if you have questions or need help.  He recognizes that most are there because they need to not because they are in love with the subject so he does what he can to help u pass",2011-01-17 01:07:39
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2107,"First of all, he's a REALLY nice guy.  Very relaxed and informal.  His lectures, however, are painfully boring.  You get the info you need if you don't fall asleep in the process.  He's a super easy marker, though, and the midterms were very easy.",2010-11-24 15:46:51
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Really politically smart guy, sure knows his stuff. Fun lecturer, but sometimes I felt unprepared for exams because everything felt very freestyle.",2010-05-03 15:03:16
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"absolutely loved this teacher! VERY chill, good lectures. Hard to keep up with because he talks so fast, but the information he gives is very well structured and very helpful for finals. He gave the questions to the midterm and the final and allowed cheat sheets!!!! Definitely the best part. It helped SO much and made things so much less stressful.",2009-12-25 11:29:36
Wolfgang Koerner,POL3162,"Great Prof! Highly engaging. Fair marker and understands student conditions. Took this during summer session and the prof made assignment guidelines fair so we could ""still enjoy summer"". Very flexible on assignment structure/content!",2009-10-23 14:24:31
Wolfgang Koerner,POL3162,"Great professor! Really knows what he is talking about, and is able to bridge theory to real world events.",2009-08-26 13:23:44
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Awesome prof! Had him twice in first year. If you just go to class and listen to what he says, there's no way you can mess it up.",2009-08-06 14:58:37
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2101,Great lectures. Super Slack.,2009-05-20 23:30:02
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"This Prof was amazing! SO nice, really approachable, take home midterm, gives you questions for exam. So it's easy BUT!!! You HAVE to come to class and take notes because otherwise you have nothing to work off of. The lectures can be boring sometimes (ok many times) but he says the most random things to make you laugh :) GO KOERNER!!!",2009-01-15 13:43:30
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Great prof, especially for a Monday morning! Missed a couple of classes here and there, but, if you know how to use google, you're covered. Especially for the midterms and final. Gives you the questions before hand. Cheat sheet is allowed. Funny guy (throws in jokes now and then) and lets you go after an hour or so. Taking another class",2009-01-04 06:09:39
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Great prof! The course material can be a bit boring and he acknowledges this. Adds some jokes to keep it interesting. The midterm was a take home exam and the questions on the final were handed out ahead of time. Very straightforward. He does talk fast so pay attention, take good notes and you'll do well!",2008-12-19 23:18:20
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Man, this guy is wicked! boring, but he knows that so he throws in some jokes from time to time. I havnt studied, looked at notes or anything, and im doing fine. Just go to the lectures, listen, and try to stay off facebook.",2008-11-13 08:21:10
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"So easy... like everyone else said with the midterms and exams. Do not buy the textbook: as long as you go to lecture and get notes, you will be fine. I haven't used mine at all, not even for the midterm. Very funny, will school you on your politics if you say something dumb in class. Awesome all around.",2008-11-06 16:07:20
Wolfgang Koerner,POLA,"Do not buy the text book for this course. Especially if you have taken itro to canadian politics. (1102)- just go to every class and take notes. Even then, I missed about two three hour classes (actually they usually lasted about two hours) and got an A on both exams. Ridiculously easy.",2008-08-07 18:23:02
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,solid prof,2008-04-03 22:31:39
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1100,"This class couldn't have been any easier if he wrote the exams for us. A take-home midterm and a final he tells you the questions for ahead of time. Definitely take if you want a bird course that requires no effort. He's a really nice guy, just doesn't seem that into teaching. Funny and nice though!",2008-01-22 15:11:52
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,This guy is awesome!  You'll love him.  He's so chills.  He knows some of the content can be dry and basic so he adds in little comments and it's so funny!  I had him at 8:30 on Monday's but I went EVERY time 'cause it was worth it.  Take his class.,2007-12-25 00:29:59
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Good prof. Sometimes he can be a little mono-toned and boring, but the class is easy and enjoybale. No complaints :).",2007-12-23 20:14:17
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Wolfy was amazing! Awesome prof, lightens your day. Totally gets it and is everything anyone would aspire to be...what can i say the man is a legend Easy class, light workload treats you like an adult...Total genius!",2007-12-13 13:34:25
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,Excellent Prof. Wonderful lectures. Light workload. Easy class.,2007-12-12 16:18:31
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"Lectures kind of boring, but Professor Koerner acknowledges this, and tries to make them as interesting as possible. Midterm was a take home and very easy, as he basically told us exactly what to write...and did the same for the final. He does not posts lectues on-line though. I would recommend this class for anyone wanting/needing an easy class.",2007-12-01 20:06:34
Wolfgang Koerner,POL1101,"A man with real world invalvment in what he is teaching. Funny and to the point, never lets you down.",2007-12-01 12:00:51

Wolfgang Koerner,POL3202,He is pretty boring in his lectures...but seems pretty good.....,2005-11-09 09:41:03
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2203,"One of the (few) great professors in the school.  Treats students like adults and equals.  Solid lecturer.  Exams are easy if you go to the lectures, and are really easy if you actually do the readings (few people in the class did).",2005-08-04 12:29:08
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2203,He made the classes funny. He knew his stuff. It was annoying when he wouldn't show up to class without warning. Attendance to his classes is important because there is no way anyone actually reads everything that is assigned so his lecture notes are important summaries of the readings.,2005-08-04 12:06:31
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,"I really learned a lot in his class and enjoyed it to the max.  Professor Koerner treates his students like adults and allows them to work at their own pace.  It is, however, not a class for slackers who won't go out of their way to do the readings.  But hey, afterall, it is university people.",2005-06-30 10:19:18

Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,"Knows the course is boring as hell and doesn't try to disguise that fact. Makes it easy though, lectures are clear and reptitive. Helpful when you ask questions. Does practically everything short of writing the exam for you.",2004-12-01 23:33:03
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,"Awesome guy, he made me want to teach poli sci just to be like him when i grow up.",2004-11-30 18:51:23

Wolfgang Koerner,POL3602,Cool prof. Summer was fun with him! and fair markings. Does not BS you. Bluntly honest in regard to the assignments - and I loved it! Treated me like an a adult... cannot say the same for my other profs. UO needs more profs like him. I got my $ worth! By,2004-10-01 13:11:19

Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,Koerner is awesome! He's got a great sense of humour...definitely one of the most entertaining profs. He knows his stuff and tries to make the best out of a lot of heavy material. I highly recommend him for political thought.,2004-03-22 13:16:05
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,"Considering I pay for a 3 hour class and am lucky to get half of that every week, maybe they should start getting guys like this in line. Oh yeah, put some passion into your work.",2004-03-20 19:45:08
Wolfgang Koerner,THOUGHT,"I find him to be the best prof. I've had so far. He won't give you all the BS material, just what you need to know. He's funny too.",2003-11-25 09:16:57
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,Too much reading in too little time. Good prof nonetheless. Has a good sense of humour and cracks funny jokes during boring Aristotelian and Platonic lectures.,2003-11-17 00:59:28
Wolfgang Koerner,THOUGHT,what a waste of $'s,2003-04-07 12:56:27
Wolfgang Koerner,POL2207,"Very funny, very easygoing. He realises the bore that is POL2207 and lets you know what's important, and what you don't need to know... and did I mention he's really funny?",2003-03-30 13:26:12

Wolfgang Koerner,POL2201,"I would very much suggest taking his courses.  His lectures never last more than an hour.  Very relaxed class atmosphere.  Very very light workload.  If you really want an A+, you'll have to work a bit but it won't be that hard to do.",2003-03-27 09:58:10
