Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Amazing prof, shows true passion while teaching. Makes sure everything is understandable. Responds to emails within seconds. Not much to say he is one of the best profs in this uni would take again in a heartbeat.
Only complain: Labs are sometimes a bit unclear",2023-02-24 06:07:22
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,As long as you attend the lectures and take some time to understand the material Gohary is one of the best professors you can take.,2022-08-09 15:37:37
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"This professor responds to emails in 2-3m most days no joke! On top of all of this, he is talented and makes a very difficult course look easy. If anyone says this professor is bad they are simply lying because they did not put the effort needed to pass the course. 10/10 would recommend",2022-06-13 02:01:09
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Excellent Professor, his live lectures were all great. He makes everything very clear and is very good at answering questions/clarifying concepts.

Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Prof. Gohary is great! His lectures are really informative and have a great amount of depth. Additionally, he is humorous and always made the lectures interesting. The material itself is not the easiest, so make sure to pay attention to the lectures, do the homework sets, and thoroughly understand the labs. Overall, I had a great experience!",2021-05-03 01:01:13
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Honestly the best prof I have ever encountered. I won't say the class is easy but if you attend and pay attention you will be good, and if you need any extra help he would def be accessible outside of class. He is just a great guy, helped me with school and non-school related subjects. I would 100% recommend!!",2021-03-04 02:04:37
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Hand's down the best prof I have had so far. Really wants you to understand the material and gives you everything needed to do so. You need to put in a lot of work outside of class reviewing the notes, so I recommend playing close attention to his words and diagrams in class and using his provided Toward's Hardware/Software packages as study notes",2020-10-03 23:23:42
Ramy Gohary,SYSC4907,"Ramy is by many accounts one of the best profs you could have for the capstone project. But beware, you won't get by if you're slacking. The projects he runs require a lot of work, thinking, and the correct use of engineering and research principles. I had a great time during the project, and it was invaluable for my future. I 100% recommend him.",2020-06-04 19:48:23
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,One of the most caring professors you will ever meet. He gives you tough dad vibes where he acts tough in class but he really cares a lot about his students. He taught the course really well given the circumstances. Doesn't allow phones in class which is for the better.,2020-05-16 05:36:12
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Lol good prof.,2020-04-12 20:36:52
Ramy Gohary,SYSC5004,"Convex Optimization course is mathematically heavy, but Ramy has his own way to dissect concepts into digestible chunks. He is always available outside the class. Exams are not that tough. He is kind and caring. He is a funny guy. You won't feel boredom because he is very energetic. By far one of the best. God bless him.",2020-03-26 20:22:02
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"Many students from non-computer majors come in and watch his lectures. He is extremely knowledgeable, funny, and engaging. The midterm and exams are hard, but he truly does want every student to pass. He changed the grading scheme when a lot of people failed the midterm to ensure those students could still pass.",2020-03-21 21:54:36
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Excellent Professor that puts genuine effort into his lectures. Very generous with midterm marking and wants everyone to do well. Easy A if you go to his lectures since he explains everything very well in them.,2019-08-21 22:59:37

Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,I have taken his master course for advanced digital communication. He is one of the tough grader and won't pass you easily. Out of 45 student around 25 student get to the final exam. He passed only few. I recommend you to not take his course.,2019-06-10 01:56:46
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Lectures were really good. writes everything on the board makes you more engaged with material. Expectations for midterm/exam weren't too far fetched. one of the better profs. Some quotes: SIR! Did u pay tuition? then ask your question!!! the homework questions depend on what I had for dinner last night My job is to make you happy,2019-04-30 18:39:01
Ramy Gohary,SYSC5605,Professor Ramy is one of the best teachers in Carleton. He is amazing and will inspire you through his lectures.,2019-04-24 18:13:43
Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,Ramy was the best Prof i ever had . I love the way he doesnt let the students to use their cellphones and laptops. it REALLY helped.

Ramy Gohary,SYSC2320,"What an amazing prof! Prof Gohary really took his time to explain every single concept in the lectures, even the small details and was always available for questions outside of class.

Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"One of the best profs at Carleton. He makes what could be a boring class interesting. He also is very passionate about what he teaches. If you do poorly on a midterm or quiz, he usually gives an opportunity for students to bounce back and receive a good grade. Attend lectures as he gives examples that are usually on the quizzes or exams.",2017-09-12 12:10:13
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3601,"Prof. Gohary is the best professor I have had in my three years at Carleton.  He genuinely cares about his students.  In our class of about 40 people, he learned every single student's name.  His quizzes every other week keep you up to date without being too stressful, and his grading is very fair.  Come and listen in class and you will do well.",2016-04-21 22:12:31
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Great, interesting prof and lectures. Explains everything about the course, you could probably understand it straight out of highschool.

Easy labs. Fave prof.",2016-03-06 08:53:07
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Gives great lectures and is always happy to help in office hours. There are tests every few weeks based on the homework (so do the homework for sure!!) which keeps you up to date throughout the semester.

Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Great course, great teacher. when u ask a question, explains the answer instead of just saying it. can find textbook online but u dont ever really need it.

Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"good prof. do your hw, moderately hard mid, easy final.",2015-11-18 21:20:16
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Very helpful prof. If you dont understand something, ask! He will take the time to clarify in the lecture or during office hours and makes sure you understand. Buy the textbook! If you can do the few problems in the book, you will do great on his quizs or exams.",2015-06-25 09:12:26
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Cannot go wrong with Dr Gohary. He's an excellent lecturer (handwriting does need a little work ;) ), and genuinely wants every student taking his course to succeed. The course is an easy A, as long as you're willing to dedicate time to the homework he gives.",2015-04-15 00:32:40
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,DO THE PROBLEM SETS! I didnt and thats reflected in my grade. If you did the problem sets.. easy A,2015-03-25 10:51:40
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3600,"Ramy is super-disorganized and his lecturers are a mess. That said, his examples are useful and often straight from the book. The weekly quiz is usually easy if you understand what's going on. Labs are an easy joke. His midterm is just like the homework, and 56 of the final questions THE SAME as homework questions. Same numbers and everything.",2014-12-28 21:20:59
Ramy Gohary,SYSC4600,Very helpful when you approach him with questions. Very respectful and polite to students. Great Professor. Class was very math heavy but he was more than willing to teach background concepts first. He expects students to do the assigned problems. Midterm and final were fair and based on assigned problems. Definitely recommend this Professor.,2013-12-18 19:41:11
Ramy Gohary,SYSC3503,"Clear, Helpful and Interesting. All in all, a great professor.",2013-08-17 10:01:59

Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She wants you to succeed. There are SO many opportunities for bonus marks it's not even funny. Every bonus opportunity is also a meaningful example to engage with the course material in a practical way.

Her brightspace page is also organized really well with plenty examples and videos of her walking through solutions.

You can't do poorly in this.",2022-05-18 14:06:18
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"Amazing prof. Great lectures, fair exams, always available for questions. Very fun class overall.",2022-05-09 22:23:50
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"This Professor does an awful job teaching online. Her lectures are very confusing considering that they are all pre-recorded videos from pervious years. I've had her as a prof for 4 diff courses, & my experience keeps getting worse and worse. The best part? A final exam with 85 questions, where 20 of them are long answer and 65 mcq. ",2022-04-21 00:46:55
Lynn Marshall,SYSC4907,Super organized! great 4th year project supervisor. Good feedback. Understanding and keeps you motivated. Schedules weekly meetings to encourage team for progress. Pleasant to work with. very responsive and easy to get in touch with. Happy to have my 4th year project supervised by her!,2022-03-06 21:02:01
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"The gem of the engineering department. Professor Marshall uses pre-recorded lectures, which may sound discouraging, but everything that is on the tests, assignments, exams, and labs are found there. She very clearly explains everything you need to know at a pace that makes it easy to learn, and is easily accessible outside of class if you need help",2022-01-11 01:17:06
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"If I were you, I'd avoid taking classes with Lynn Marshall. She posts pre-recorded videos from 2019, takes days to respond to simple emails , creates difficult midterms and finals and isn't really the nicest or most encouraging person out there.",2021-12-12 00:41:27
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"Professor Marshal is one of the best professors in the Eng dept. Her lectures explain everything you need to know, and all her TAs are accessible outside of class via Discord & email. As long as you watch the lectures, the assignments and labs won't be a problem whatsoever. Extremely organized professor, and explains everything thoroughly & easily.",2021-09-17 19:21:59
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"One of my favourite profs I've had. She genuinely wants her students to do well. She can be particular on how things are done and submitted, but is always super clear on what she expects beforehand. Easy to do well if you put in some effort.",2021-04-25 18:34:08
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1042,Final exams are worth a lot of the grade and it doesn't reflect what was learned in the class. Does not explain well and the CUlearn page is so disorganized it's hard to find the material and you miss some important information.,2021-02-27 19:11:45
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Ecor1041-1042 She is a nice professor and has good structure in her lectures. I tend to ask a lot of questions to ensure a thorough understanding of the criteria because sometimes it isn't explicit. I didn't find the course hard, but the final exam is not a good reflection of the quizzes, labs or material. It is more difficult than it needs to be.",2021-02-27 17:41:47
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,Best prof ever,2021-02-22 23:10:07
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,The course page was very disorganized and the midterm and final exam we're so difficult. It was not a hard class but she made the final exam soooooo hard when it did not reflect what we learned in class.,2021-01-30 16:18:04
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"doesnt care about students at all. Try to reason with her about unfair marking and she dismisses u. Wants you to fail. Beginners in comp. sci. will have an extremely difficult time trying to ""learn"" from her and from ""professor"" yuu ono. Worst experienced with human beings I have ever had in my life. Ask for ALL lab criteria, bc they try to hide it",2021-01-26 18:19:43
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1041,"Horrible Professor 0/100. Had to submit Labs in the semester, through CULearn, where you sign in using your student account. I had to submit two labs in the same week, which is typical. I forgot to put my name on them. I got a 0/100 on both because my name wasn't on the submission file, submitted through my account. But they knew who to email.",2021-01-26 17:49:34
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"Prof. Marshall is really great! Her lectures are extremely well organized and she goes through many examples to further understanding. The grading criteria is also very clear. The labs/assignments were fairly simple. I found the midterm and final to be moderately difficult, but overall fair. If you are up-to-date in this course, you will do well!",2021-01-07 16:37:30
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Can't write a coherant question to save her, yells you to read the text book for course material , isn't hard but the exam was very crammed for no reason. cuLearn page is well thought out but poorly executed.",2020-12-17 01:22:11
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Culearn page is confusing at best, exam times too short for what is expected, She is way too vague in her answers to questions, this was for Ecor1041 which she teaches but wasn't an option to choose.",2020-12-16 20:43:32
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"continuing from below, DO NOT NEGOTIATE WITH TEAMMATES WHO DONT EVEN PARTICIPATE, PROF WILL DO NOTHING GOOD FOR U FOR THESE HAPPENINGS. and also, whoever says 'dont worry. i will finish my work done soon' thats a completely lie, just ignore that person as soon as ur team deadline is over. i should have done this instead of communicate with prof",2020-11-24 19:40:04
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"4 ppl group project, it was really painful to do the group assignment because one guy never showed and the other guy showed up 4 hours before the submission all the time ,we had to rearranged lol. just me and another member did basically everything and managed schedules. team contract does nothing and the prof took no action to the trouble we had.",2020-11-24 19:30:47
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"The workload is too heavy, but you guess what - you perfectly did an assignment for 8 hours which only worth 0.5% and you did a three-hour test worth 50%!! This means even you work so hard and get everything prepared, you still would get a terrible grade eventually. The lecture is so-so, actually not that effective. Take the textbook seriously.",2020-06-16 04:00:46
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1051,"Amazing prof. Puts a lot of effort into her CUlearn page and lectures. You need to put in a lot of work in her classes, but the expectations are very clear. I would take her again",2020-06-07 01:56:54
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,She was a good prof. She had a set of her own notes so it her lectures was easy to follow. Definitely recommend to practice and study on your own. Midterm was easy but final was hard. The labs require some work but it is doable.,2020-05-22 20:25:15
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,She really cares about her students. Responds to emails quickly. Lots of bonuses in the class (around an extra 7%) which will really help. Final was long and had a few tough questions.,2020-01-08 06:23:52
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Very tough,2019-08-14 14:45:36
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,She is the best guys. Believe me.,2019-05-18 17:16:36
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,Very good prof. Explains the lecture well. Make sure you do ALL labs and assignments by yourself and prepare before class at least.,2019-05-04 23:08:42
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"She has the most monotone voice I have ever heard. I used to fall asleep every single lecture. Drink a coffee before hand. 1606 is an easy course. She explains things in a clear way, especially for the students who are complete noobs to coding. Overall, good prof",2019-04-18 03:18:54
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,"Good prof, the people who don't do well in the class don't do the work. She provides plenty of material, practice and homework on her culearn (I don' think any other prof puts as much effort as her into her culearn). The lectures were good even though a bit boring at times. Definitely couldn't ask for a better prof for comp sci",2019-03-22 17:10:14
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,Dr marshall was a good prof. I dont think the content of 1606 doesn't lend itself to interesting lectures but she made an effort to make it fun. Try your best to follow along with her code during in-class examples. The labs are nice practice to keep yourself on track. The course material is easy but be careful not to slack off too much.,2019-01-06 06:23:40
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2006,The worst professor ever. She writes the hardest exams on earth. She wants people to keep on failing and not passing her course. I heard she is good in Ecor 1606 but in sysc 2006 shes hell.,2019-01-04 05:41:35
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"ECOR1606 Doesnt actually teach, just talks and types and doesnt get the class involved. You actually learn how to do stuff in the lab sessions. There is almost no need to show up to her class after the second week.",2018-11-14 11:53:14
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"Given the content of this class the lectures are extremely boring, however Lynn is excellent at explaining the material. This class is very manageable if you keep on top of it and it is fairly easy to get a good lab mark.",2018-02-03 18:18:57
Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"zyBooks is this course's homework. Complete a chapter every 1-2 weeks if you like keeping up with lectures. Do the Mock Midterms/Finals PASS sends out. Go to the takeup,helps prepare you. Typing up in-class examples as the prof does them helps you out. You can follow along in the textbook too. Doing Problem sets 2-3 helps for the Lab Midterm.",2017-12-28 03:52:35
Lynn Marshall,SYSC2004,"She does not explain well. Uses online references mostly instead of her own explanation for the course material.

Lynn Marshall,ECOR1606,"ECOR 1606 is a easy but boring course that is slow for 5/6 of the course then picks up at the end. Lynn is a good prof for this course, as you know what is expected of you. Her reviews for any of the evaluations very well done and extremely helpful.",2017-05-22 15:15:16

Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,"All in she's a good prof. That said DO NOT take 3303 with her in the summer, she expect you to do 12 weeks of spread out work in 6 weeks and still marks hard (no clear marking scheme). She also writes marathon exams and midterms like go into the exam and try to do as much as possible correctly not finish cause u wont. Expect to do late nights.",2016-06-23 00:04:04
Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Skipped maybe 23/25 lectures. Then I realized she's a great person, but during the lectures, it's almost as if she's explaining the concept to herself and not the class; it's hard to stay focused on what's going on. Very helpful in person, she usually comes to visit the labs.  Do the labs with their bonuses. Solve previous exams/midterms, ur set.",2016-03-06 09:07:41
Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"Lynn marshall well it's lynn marshall watching paint dry is more interesting than her lectures. The labs are great but long.

Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"I learned the entire course by doing the labs. This prepared me for the MATLab section of the class whereas youtube tutorials taught me the ""by hand"" methods.

Lynn Marshall,ECOR2606,"This is a boring class in the first place but she teaches it well and manages to make some of it interesting. Her lectures are great but it is hard to tell exactly what will be on the midtermfinal. If this course has PASS, GO TO THE MOCK MIDTERMFINAL!!!",2015-05-01 09:17:51

Some of the stuff at the end (like Linked List and everything it led up to), I found helpful for the classes, although if they are still selling the course notes, than I'd suggest buying those and reading them on your own time which beat attending lectures.

Lynn Marshall,SYSC3303,Not a nice lady... has an intimidating presence.  Likes to give long and hard midterms and even harder finals.  Extremely picky at marking - must have perfect syntax.  Not very helpful when you speak to her either - will make you wish you didn't ask.,2004-08-17 19:49:41

Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,"Personally, I don't think she deserves the rate she has right now, she taught the course material pretty well with examples and seemed knowledgeable.

Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Dr. Martin is much better in person, although she has little control over the exams, she delivers course content in the most digestible manner possible.

Most of the poor reviews are from salty first years.",2022-12-26 23:39:41
Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2006,"Cristina is quite decent (despite the bad reviews).

Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1042,she genuinely makes no sense. Its very hard to understand her and she cuts you off before you even finish asking your question. I also have no idea how I am doing in the course as the final exam is in 3 days and I haven't received any of my grades (apart from 3 quizzes that brightspace provides the grade back instantly). ,2022-12-15 02:23:27

Cristina Ruiz Martin,ECOR1041,The only reason I got an A in this class was because I had prior experience programing. She did not actually run any lectures but prepared the course material for instructors. The lecturers were poor and hard to learn from. The labs instructions were unclear and poorly written. The exam contained a section that was not covered on in class. ,2022-11-24 04:12:52
Cristina Ruiz Martin,SYSC2004,I took the course as an online offering in 2021. She uploaded short 20 min lectures that had nothing to do with the assignments and the lab. The assignments were pretty much an open-ended project. She was extremely unhelpful throughout the terms. Her exams were insanely difficult. ,2022-11-16 22:47:17

The final is worth 50% and about 80 of 100 questions on it are useless theory",2019-12-26 20:16:11
Mengchi Liu,COMP3005,"Reads off years-old slides each class. Barely audible, barely understandable.

He's incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about what he does and makes the lectures fun and entertaining. I wish I could've taken this class in person, so I could go on his bird walks!",2020-10-22 20:30:59
Michael Runtz,BIO1902,Absolutely hilarious. Lots of jokes in his lectures. Slides use lots of beautiful pictures which he took himself. Too bad that I took this class as VOD and not in person. Whole course was basically just memorizing definitions but he is very passionate about his content and comes up with easy ways to remember things (PS VERY much a valley man lol),2020-09-10 14:53:53
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"The absolute best prof I have ever had. It really makes a difference to have a passionate prof.

Runtz is one of the best profs I've had.",2020-02-03 00:58:16
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Can't say I'm the biggest fan of biology, and I was expecting to dread every single minute of taking the class as I needed a science course to graduate but I can honestly say that I don't think there was ever a dull moment in that class. Michael Runtz truly cares about what he teaches and spreads the enthusias throughout his lectures! Amazing prof!",2020-01-15 04:17:28
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Take notes during the lecture and memorize them and you should be good (it is a lot of memorizing though but its do-able). You dont need the book!! Funny prof and most of the time the info is actually interesting.,2020-01-12 03:58:33
Michael Runtz,BIO1902,Such a passionate Prof! 35% midterm and 65% multiple choice final. The lectures are entertaining and he brings many real animals to class. The only downside is that the multiple choice exams have 5 options instead of 4. Overall great Prof!,2019-12-19 05:43:49
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Prof Runtz is such an engaging lecturer. I'm happy he is doing this course even though he is on sabbatical. He's really entertaining and makes you enjoy the content.

Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Wow. Just Wow. I changed my major to psychology because I decided to become a clinical psychologist, and as a consequence, I required science electives. I took biol 1902 and 2903 because I thought the would be the ""easiest"" A+. Well, from initially having no interest in nature, I have developed a new hobby. Birdwatching. 10/10 would recommend A++++",2019-05-01 19:02:34
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902V,Professor Runtz was amazing! You really need to pay attention in the lectures because he tends to get a little side tract. He does not provide the sides he uses so you need to show up in order to get the content. Textbook is not mandatory. He is absolutely hilarious and is really good at explaining the content. I would highly recommend this course.,2019-04-30 12:51:40

Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Don't get me wrong I love him I had him in 1902 and I decided to take 2903. He is so funny and I love his courses however I will warn people that it is not as easy as 1902 at all. The exam was extremely difficult (much harder then the midterm even). Course is interesting but I wouldn't recommend taking it as an ""easy"" elective (A LOT to memorize!)",2019-04-28 15:38:40
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Mike is awesome and very passionate about what he teaches! I could not recommend him enough. This class is no joke though - i know many people take it as an elective because they believe it will be ""easy"" but it is A LOT of information and A LOT of memorization of topics you may have never encountered before. Very interesting but not a bird-course.",2019-04-24 22:20:00
Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Hes hilarious passionate, and will some times hint at material that will be on a quiz or exam. He was one of the reasons I switched my minor to biology!

Michael Runtz,BIOL4500,"This is a tough class, but he ends class early every week, and if you go to class and pay attention, you will do fine.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Professor Runtz is a bit of an icon at Carleton, and for good reason! His lectures are amazing, and if you take good notes during them you won't need to crack the textbook, even though it is a good read.

Michael Runtz,1902T,"Absolute amazing prof! Not in the biology program but if I was I would try and get into every one of his classes. Super important to go to lectures. He is able to cover a lot in one, but it is easy to remember. Exams and midterms all multiple choice and if you study and go/watch the lectures it is easy. Super engaging, 10/10 recommend!",2018-06-30 00:15:01
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"I really enjoyed learning from someone who is so passionate and excited about the subject. His lectures are really detailed and there's a lot to remember, but his corny jokes and the visual aids really helped. All MC but most questions have one obvious wrong answer. This is a great non-sciencey science credit!",2018-06-27 10:43:17
Michael Runtz,1902BIO,obviously cares about the subject matter and spends his lectures trying to get his students as involved and passionate as he is. Heavy heavy memorization but pretty cool stuff. All MC,2018-06-21 16:03:19
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"I did very well in his BIOL 1903 class, so I was expecting this class to go the same. While I did well the first half of the semester, the second half did not go so well. I still got a decent mark, but his MC became too complicated and too much. A lot to memorize, so if you have other heavy classes don't take this class at the same time.",2018-05-30 11:45:57
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902V,Professor Runtz provides engaging lectures packed full with neat facts about Natural History in Canada. You do not need to read the textbook since all material is covered in lecture. Exams and tests are all memorization based so if you struggle to memorize names of plant and animal species you will struggle. I recommend this course to everyone,2018-04-28 21:24:07
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Professor Runtz is awesome and clearly he is very happy to be teaching about animals/plants, etc. However the amount of things you have to memorize is crazy. I would recommend taking this in the summer, it is a lot to remember. He also rambles quite a bit and jumps from one concept to another.",2018-04-21 17:40:55
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Awesome prof! One of the best at Carleton. BIOL1902 is THE class to take for the science breadth requirement if you're an Arts student who's intimidated by science. Prof Runtz makes the material accessible and fun. Lots of memorization, but if you make flash cards after every lecture and study them each week, it's not difficult to get an A+++++",2018-04-20 08:43:44
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"If you enjoy studying a lot of notes (and i mean A LOT) then you'll enjoy this class and it'll be a breeze. His notes aren't super complex. Tests are reasonably easy as they are multiple choice and true and false. If you don't study, don't bother taking this class, you'll probably fail unless you're Mike Ross. Great prof overall.",2018-04-19 01:04:01
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"If you took first year Natural History his second year class is a similar layout. He does go more in depth and there's a lot of definitions / facts to know. However, the material isn't difficult. If you don't go to class you won't pass, the final was 181 questions and there was at least 5 questions per lecture.",2018-04-18 21:20:42
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,Dont take BIOL 2903 as an elective. I took it as an elective because I took the first year course and got an A+. BIOL2903 is so ridiculous compared to the first year course. It is pretty much memorizing 50 pages worth of material (plant and animal names). Its ridiculous how much he expects us to know and certainly not fair. Dont fool yourself!,2018-04-16 18:02:29

Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Honestly the best Prof I've ever had. The textbook isn't mandatory but he did it all himself and it's the best textbook I've ever had too. Definitely worth the price knowing how passionate he is about it! If you're looking for electives, take his courses!

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Amazing and inspiring professor. I took his class as an elective and haven't regretted it at all.

For example, on the 4501 final, you must scientifically describe, in full, a species you will have never seen before. The final was 2hrs written, 2hrs bell-ringer.",2018-01-03 01:27:58
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,I took Natural History with Michael Runtz and his class encouraged me to switch programs into a Biology related field.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Originally took this class cause I dropped an elective and it was one of the only things left but it turned out to be such an interesting class.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"LEGENDARY lectures. 350 characters are not nearly enough to fully capture how brilliant this man is. Even if you're not usually interested in nature (like me) it's impossible not to be entertained. (To the rater complaining about misogyny, relax.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"As a Psyc major, this non psyc elective was kind of mandator. Initially I was scared as I hadn't taken a biology course since high school.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Favourite prof I've ever had. Highly recommend talking Biol 1902 (Natural History). Great class if you have a sense of humour as well.,2011-11-26 13:45:55
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Well fantastic to see that good old Runtzy is still doing a great job of helping students explore the natural history of our world. I took this course 20 years ago and Mike was just as much fun and interesting then. He is 1 of only 2 profs I actually remember by name because it was interesting. Have fun with the class. Study...lots to memorize,2011-11-16 13:08:02
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Took 1902 and loved it so much I took 2903. So glad I did! No textbooks required for 1902, and though he highly recommends getting them for 2903, I didn't really use mine. If you have a great memory and a sense of humour, this course is for you! Runtz is wonderful.",2011-09-19 16:57:12
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Prof. Runtz extremely well versed in Natural Biology/History and knows local wildlife better than most provincial park representatives.  Top quality professor at Carleton. Quickly responds to emails and helps every way he can. A bit odd and loopy at times as his memory is fading but still on the ball. He does not like technology but still uses it.,2011-08-18 14:08:38
Michael Runtz,BIO1902,"Fantastic! Funny, lively, passionate about the course he teaches and makes it very interesting...just awesome!",2011-07-25 20:18:16
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Great proff.  He's passionate, funny, and very engaging.  It brought back to me the passion I had in learning about animals in the 5th grade.  Also, No textbook for this class!  If you are a psych student, like me, looking for your science credits TAKE THIS CLASS!  (2 very fair M/C exams-finished with an A+)",2011-07-06 10:16:21
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Easiest course ever. Cool prof from just watching him teach, but a total a**hole if you talk to him. Will not take another class with him simply for that reason.",2011-06-27 12:03:14
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Very good Proff! Very smart and interested in course material. No textbook required. He provides detailed notes. No assignments. Exams are long, but all multiple choice. He's really funny and interesting!",2011-06-20 16:48:25
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Seriously funny and extremely passionate about wildlife. Very encouraging. Lots to memorize, but makes the exams fair. Texts aren't really necessary. Highly recommended.",2011-04-21 11:21:18
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"Brilliant!! Not only is he a great teacher but his compassion for wildlife is contagious. If you are devoid of a sense of humour, maybe not the class for you, otherwise..for a good time take this course!!",2011-04-20 23:04:42
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"This prof is amazing. He gets so excited about what he's teaching, which is refreshing compared to some other profs. There is a lot of material to learn, but he makes it so interesting. VERY FUNNY! Will definitely take another class with him again.",2011-04-18 10:38:44
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"I don't think he needs anymore comments about how amazing he is but here is another one!! He is great! This is a HARD class tho and I think I just bombed the final there is A LOT of material and to many birds, trees, and other animals to know in such a short period...but i still have nothing mean to say hahaha.",2011-04-15 18:00:41
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Very passionate about what he is teaching, which is a good thing. Makes wildly inappropriate references and is rude. Don't expect to ask a question without a smart ass remark. Definitely will not be taking one of his classes again.",2011-04-13 15:36:02
Michael Runtz,BIOL1903,I have an unhealthy obsession with Crows and Ravens. I want to have a beer or two with Mike Runtz and talk about Crows and Ravens for several hours.,2011-04-05 12:32:12
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"This prof is amazing - he loves what he teaches and you can't help but love it too. i went out of my way in my final year to take both of his classes because he adds such a breath of fresh air to your semester. if you pay attention, you will rock this course.",2011-03-10 20:25:41

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Best Professor I've ever had. He is so funny and entertaining and I am amazed at how much knowledge he has on his subject.

This became my favorite course even though I had no previous interest.,2011-01-28 12:11:52
Michael Runtz,BIO1902,I LOVE THIS MANN!!! He is the Best Prof at Carleton. I wanted to save him till my 4th year but took the class now Because I cant wait. He makes the topic very interesting.,2011-01-08 04:19:55
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"VERY interesting and HILARIOUS professor. Makes a lot of jokes. Does ask for participation from random people from time to time, but with encouragement rather than intimidation. NO textbook required. Be sure to write down whatever isn't in brackets - will help so much preparing for exam (look at the notes he posts, too; they're helpful).",2010-12-21 12:05:01
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"This is by far the most interesting and BEST prof I've ever had at Carleton, but this class is definitely not a ""bird"" course.  It requires you to memorize a LOT of material and attend/watch all lectures! Probably only going to end up with a C and I actually tried/ put in a lot of work! Don't use this as an average booster.",2010-12-19 09:53:35
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Amazing prof! extremely funny. Material is very interesting. He loves his job and of course NATURE! Exams are straight forward and easy. One thing I wasn't so comfortable with in his class was how sometimes he'd randomly pick on someone to answer a question. Pretty awkward!,2010-12-12 00:38:37
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,great!,2010-11-16 15:51:29

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,Best class ever! (This is coming from an business student.. out of my element) He made it really fun and exciting... Highly recommended A++++++++         Plus he brings frogs (live) to class and picks up porcupines (roadkill) so you can go to his car and look at them. haha :),2010-07-28 23:50:07
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"I'm not surprised there are so many positive comments for Runtz. He'll probably never read this but I wish he would because he's the most fantastic professor I've ever had and I encourage any potential Natural History students to take his course(s). Brilliant, wonderful, funny, passionate, amazing professor.",2010-07-11 01:38:56
Michael Runtz,BIO1902,I love Runtz. He should get an A++++++ for being the best prof at Carleton. Who would have thought animals and plants could be so interesting. Loved the class.,2010-07-04 00:25:19
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"A fantastic elective.  Excellent lectures by the most passionate prof I've had.  This course will give you a new appreciation of nature and the life it sustains.  Very rewarding.  YOu've got to study for the exams, but it's all MC and very easy if you're prepared.",2010-06-30 18:20:40
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"This class had too much useless information and too many bugs and insect names that you had to commit to memory. I found the classes themselves interesting but studying for the exams was brutal as I did not care about the material in the slightest. As a science student, this class was wasting time that could've been used studying for other courses",2010-06-19 08:21:09
Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"I had this prof. Biol 1902 & 2903. The most interesting course you can take. Great Prof, informative and facinating. He's really funny and makes class really fun. Best class, life learning experience.",2010-05-08 13:25:18
Michael Runtz,PSYC1902,"Amazing professor! I'm a third year student and I needed to complete my science requirements, I dreaded taking biology but heard good things about this professor.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Just to add to the list of positive reviews, I concurr that Professor Runtz's Natural History courses are incredibly informative and entertaining to boot.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1903,"Do profs really get any better than this?! Thank you professor Runtz for making class so much fun.

Hilarious! and so full of knowledge!",2010-04-15 19:51:19

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,I was told that most students take this class to simply boost their GPA. So I gave it a shot and I actually enjoy what is being taught. Professor Runtz is hilarious and genuinely cares about his students.,2010-01-20 19:53:29
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"First time taking a CUTV class, and on Natural History I thought it was going to be boring as hell. However after the first week, it quickly became my favorite class!

Would love to take another class with him in the future! :)",2010-01-13 15:07:02

Michael Runtz,BIOL2903,"This professor is highly knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches. His lecture material is very interesting, and his teaching style is great because he mixes in a bit of humor during his class.

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,If you're intimidated because this is a biology course- DON'T BE.  Runtz makes everything so easy to learn and his is the only lecture I religiously watched on time every week because it's so interesting.  His exams are easy if you watch the lectures and remember the names of the animals/plants.  I wish he taught every subject!,2009-03-17 19:34:59
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,I <3 Michael Runtz. He is hilarious and even had me laughing out loud at some points.

He is a brilliant man. Best professor at Carleton!,2009-03-17 16:55:55
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"I finished this course 2 years ago and I still find myself watching when it comes on tv just because of how interesting this man is.  He is the supreme example of how a professor should be: humble, entertaining, so clear, and very fair.  Just watch the class- it's like stand up comedy but you learn so much.",2009-02-02 15:10:47

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Oh my god. Mike is by far the best prof I've had. Before taking this class I was dreading as to how I was going to survive but I ended up loving every class and quite honestly I was sad when the term ended. No textbooks but it's very important to attend or watch the classes cuz not everything he says will be in his notes. overall, BEST class ever!",2008-12-26 11:54:43
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,This was an amazing class! What an adventure it was! Runtz never fails to capture the class' attention and keep you entertained.

Michael Runtz,BIOL4500,"He's very entertaining and precise about his teachings. However, I disagree with the way he marks his tests and essay. I was greatly disappointed and discouraged. I suggest to anyone taking this course if you don't absolutly love birds don't take it. I don't think you should rate a prof based on his teaching style and assume he's a great teacher.",2007-12-14 18:23:14

A must take class for any CU student!",2007-12-05 13:56:42

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,I loved this class!  Michael is very passionate and hilarious which makes the course so much more interesting than it already is!  A lot of things to remember  and there are only 2 exams that make up the mark so you have to be as passionate as him to do well.  I wish there were more classes w/ him  that ARTS students could take.,2007-06-26 15:17:00
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"You learn so much! Exams are detailed and long, but humourous. Take the in-class if you can its like going to an informative stand up comedy show 2 times a week!

Michael Runtz,BIOL1009,"One of the top teachers I've had in uni, he's passionate and fascinating. Any student with even a remote interest in nature will love Natural History.

Michael Runtz,BIOL190,Professor Runtz is by far the most entertaining professor I've come across at Carleton. Encouraging and spontaneous he keeps everything interesting.  Where things go downhill is when you are expected to know every species of animal/plant in Ontario and distinguish between otherwise monotonous material. Exam=HARD. You MUST be solid on the material,2007-04-15 00:09:47
Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,The best professor ever! This course was so interesting I looked forward every class!

Michael Runtz,BIOL1902,"Interesting guy, very passionate and funny....my only complaint is that he doesn't provide any notes, and talks fast...tests on everything, even little itty bitty examples, so you need to write everything down; if you're not a good notetaker, don't take the class!",2006-12-14 09:58:41

John Rogers,ELEC2501,John Rogers has been the worst professor since we moved online.

John Rogers,ELEC2501,"I really enjoyed having Dr. Rogers as my professor for ELEC2501. The lectures were very succinct and concise.

John Rogers,ELEC2501,I do not recommend him at all. He does not have the characteristics of a teacher. Do not take this course in the fall if he is teaching it. He will be making the tests and the exams even if you have a different Prof.,2021-01-16 20:46:57
John Rogers,ELEC2501,One of the cruelest individuals to ever become a professor I think. Why become a professor if you hold your students in such contempt. So bad at his job that the faculty forced to give out make up finals because he cant resist failing students.,2021-01-13 21:06:19

John Rogers,ELEC2501,Really bad prof. Lectures are just him talking about notes that someone else prepared of equation derivations and one or two examples. Exam was the hardest one I've written in uni. You need to teach yourself most of the content out of the textbook (which is pretty bad on its own) or rely heavily on your ta to pull you through.,2021-01-10 18:15:38
John Rogers,ELEC2501,I don't know. This man gets off from making students miserable. Goes out of his way to fail as many students as possible to satisfy some morbid ego he has. That's the only reason I can think of for why he desires to make exams brutal and record lectures in a clock shop. Sets a pass requirement on the final to ENSURE he fails half the class.,2021-01-10 00:06:48

John Rogers,ELEC3509,Very nice prof. He tells you everything.,2017-12-13 21:32:29
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"John Rogers is an excellent Professor, despite what most of these reviews say.  The common theme is the difficulty of the class, and the in-class participation, which motivates you to attend lectures and actually put in work. He does a good job of answering questions, and the material is all given to you from his website.  Hardest class I've taken",2016-12-19 14:09:46
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Lectures barely relevant to lab, you will spend countless hours trying to understand how to do the prelab because he never really went over the theory or procedure to understand what are doing. VITAL: work with people on solving these because alone you will fail at least the first time but make sure you can do them by yourself for exams.",2016-08-17 01:53:43
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Very Hard prof, but if you are ever going to actually learn any material, this class is going to do it.  Yes its very hard, and you  MUST go to class, but this is the only grade you will truly earn in your degree",2016-07-20 21:08:53
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"I dont mind having a tough prof. that wants us to learn. This prof. takes every opportunity to fail you. If you miss more than 3 classes you fail the course. One student had a midterm and had to leave 5 min early from class, and he had a pop quiz as soon as he saw them leave. This kind of attitude should not be allowed, and doesn' motivate anyone.",2016-02-21 13:14:50
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"I find he is good at imparting the material, especially more recently where he introduced the surprise quizzes.  You cannot miss three of them or it is an auto-fail (and there is essentially no compromise on this).  He is a very tough marker though.  The labs you are not super difficult, but are definitely long, and you do have to put  the effort.",2015-11-05 14:21:50
John Rogers,3509,Lab TA's marked very differently between each other and often marked unfairly   prof didn't care about the issues in the lab and told students to deal with it. ,2015-06-09 12:05:36
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Horrible professor. Makes a core EE course too difficult and tedious. He also holds random pop quizzes in class and if you miss 3 he FNDs you. In one class a student left 5 minutes early and he intentionally held the pop quiz right after in spite. He doesn't follow a textbook, doesn't teach, he only does practice questions in class. Avoid him.",2015-03-25 22:46:37
John Rogers,ELEC3509,Get ready to get annnnallllled. Worst course of my undergrad career. Don't cram the night before.. I learned the hard way.,2015-03-25 10:44:44
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Awesome Prof. Asks you to solve problems in class instead of boring old lectures. The labs are terribly long, but everyone has copies of old labs so they are do-able. Midterm and final exam were both very fair and I'm sure he marked very easy. Go to class, participate, attempt the labs on your own, and do past midtermfinals. Good prof, good class.",2015-01-09 14:10:15
John Rogers,3509,horrible prof ,2015-01-08 12:59:35
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Rogers is a fair professor. I dropped it twice before passing it on the third attempt. Before this I was a lazy student, used to firstsecond year spoon feeding of material, not really having to think for myself. This is really the first glimpse of real engineering design. Go to class, DO LABS YOURSELF(important), vid lectures, do old exams, pass.",2015-01-07 18:46:49
John Rogers,3509,This professor doesn't teach anything in class. if you take this class you have to learn everything on your own. he just walks around the class talking to people and answering questions. doesn't explain concepts at all. doesn't answer questions on board properly. AVOID HIM.,2014-10-21 11:06:41
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"I don't know why this prof tries to make this course AS HARD AS POSSIBLE !!! talks very fast, teaches a theory very fast ! Avoid this guy if you don't have to take this course !",2014-08-02 13:15:32
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Walking around the class, hands in pocket, talking fast without pause on the circuit design like a sociology lecturer.",2014-07-31 20:04:22
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"He tells you on the first day that this course will be tough, and he's not lying. Labs and video lectures are key to understanding course material. Midterms and finals are the same every year; not tough if you solved old papers. Went into the final hoping for a C, ended up with a B+.",2014-01-25 20:57:27
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"One of the best Profs I've had. He puts in a lot of effort to bring you up to his level and gives you enough material to get an A+, if you're willing to put in the work. You will be a professional in electronics through his course. Bad comments are just by lazy students who expect to be spoon-fed ie his exam format has hardly changed in over 10yrs!",2014-01-24 19:25:27

John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Summing up all comments below: Rogers definitely knows what he is talking about, but he is not really socially smart.  He does expect certain levels of understanding from you and would get impatient after a bit.  He could (and probably would) offend you in ways that he probably didn't know himself.",2013-11-25 15:52:09

John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Rogers is not a bad guy. He`s actually very approachable and helpful. The course is based almost entirely on understanding. The lectures were very involving. Both the midterm and the final were challenging, but nonetheless fair. The labs are a pain but I learned A LOT.",2012-12-18 14:34:43
John Rogers,ELEC3509,He is very understanding and answers all your questions. Midterms and Finals are challenging. If you study his notes and watch his videos (that are very useful)you will pass the course.You can't fool around and expect to pass(study last minute). This course changed my life. Don't take this course in summer.,2012-09-25 18:45:27
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"With the constant decrease in midterm marks over the years (and probably overall final marks), John, or rather, the faculty, need(s) to approach the course differently to ensure a better passing rate. Rogers needs to take a better interest in identifying students strengths and weaknesses so students will do better.",2012-09-04 03:10:28
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Keeps you on your toes with questions in class, which is good however has an antisocial personality. Get to know him on a first name basis and you will get a good mark. Grading does not reflect student knowledge. Don't let this class hurt your mark in other classes by using all of your time; especially when it comes to the labs.",2012-08-08 13:26:13
John Rogers,ELEC3509,If you fail his course its your own fault. He will tell you at the beginning that 3509 is probably the hardest class in 3rd year. He is not lying. If you do your work and review your notes you will do well. If you have a bad attitude and expect things handed to you (some here seem that way) you will fail. He's a great guy who doesn't BS you.,2012-07-04 09:14:32
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"I failed the course (entirely my fault), but I wouldn't mind retaking the course with him again. He's not a bad prof, but the lectures are pretty dry. What I found useful though were his video lectures. They were very helpful and made me understand the course material better. My reason for failing was not practising enough questions",2012-01-11 01:08:35
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Prof Rogers just needs to care about how his students are doing and understand that the problem may come from him, especially when it comes to the amount of questions he puts on the exam/midterm. He is a smart guy and needs to understand that not everyone is like him! The more we are pressed for time to solve a problem, the more inaccurate we get.",2011-12-20 19:32:01
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"The most difficult prof I've had thus far but I've learned the most from him. If you don't do the work and prep for some of the harder lectures you will find this class too difficult and take it out on the prof. If any other Elec prof that I've had so far were to teach it, I would likely fail. The guy wants you to learn and pushes you to do so.",2011-12-03 07:47:47
John Rogers,ELEC3509,Definitely the best prof in the electrical department. His ability to explain difficult concepts is outstanding. He always makes class fun and entertaining. This course is challenging so the bad comments are simply due to students that can't handle the workload.,2011-11-29 23:38:06
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"He is my favorite professor and he is very very knowledgeable! The only downside is that he is sometimes too sarcastic when you ask him a question, and that?s a turn off when u need help. But overall I like him very much.",2011-11-10 11:06:35
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"If this is the only course you have throughout the semester you will still do bad! Lol. He is an ok person, he just never puts himself in our shoes, he believes that when the average of a class is F that it is the students fault and does not realize that it is actually his fault. The marking scheme is digital, either 1 or 0.",2011-11-06 14:02:32
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Worst professor I've ever had. The list of things he does wrong is so long it won't fit in this little box.

Don't sacrifice your other classes for his stupid class.",2011-10-29 16:21:12
John Rogers,ELEC3509,"Probably favourite prof I have had. Don't get me wrong - he is a challenging prof - but the course (Electronics II) is designed that way. He's a funny guy, and he is extremely straightforward but blunt - he will not BS you or surprise you on an exam with an unfair question (but they will be tricky). Must attend or you will fail (pretty well proven)",2011-09-05 15:41:29
John Rogers,ELEC2607,Worst prof you ever imagine.,2011-05-01 16:46:21
John Rogers,ELEC2607,He a very approachable professor and helps any student that asks questions. He does a lot of examples on the board which is useful as most of the questions covered there will be on the midterm/final. When he goes through the material he lets you know what will be important for future courses and what is important for the midterm/exam.,2010-06-16 15:24:03

People should definitely show up to his review sessions if they want to get a clear idea for what he expects on the tests. ,2022-05-06 12:46:30
Connor Kupchak,ELEC3105,"Connor gets a pretty bad rap for being associated with ELEC2501, but he's definitely one of the most caring and genuine profs you'll have in your undergrad.

Donald Bailey,SYSC2100,"Avoid this instructor at all cost. 
Lectures would not be posted on time (Up to 3 weeks late) and others were missing. The lectures could be as short as 8 minutes and did not provide any meaningful information. Over half of the material this term was review from previous courses. 7/11 Labs and 0/2 assignments were returned before the exam.

Donald Bailey,SYSC2100,"He never really answered emails, struggled to post lectures and labs on time more than once. The TAs couldn't grade a lab because they didn't receive the marking scheme.

Great guy overall",2022-01-25 17:02:29
Mohammad Hasan,LAWS3208,Professor Hasan is not only boring but he reads off the slides and does not give examples for the topics he talks about during the recorded lectures. Something to beware of is the lectures does not have anything to do with the bi-weekly quizzes and you have to do at least 20-30 pages of reading. The topic in the textbook is completely different.,2021-12-06 21:04:40

Mohammad Hasan,LAWS2201,"Prof seemed decent enough with online only course delivery in mind. The course grading was structured in a compassionate way and only ever relied on the textbook and maybe sometimes the lectures.

Mohammad Hasan,LAWS3208,"Hassan is the worst professor I have had in university, he always directs you to his TA and you can never follow up on lecture materials.

Highly recommend this prof!",2021-05-26 23:24:35

Ariel Fuenzalida,ANTH3310,Ariel was the best prof I had in university. His lectures are so engaging and hes so full of knowledge he doesnt rely on slides or textbooks. His essay topics are so open you really get the chance to research something youre interested in.

Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI2010,"Ariel was very passionate about what he was talking about and took the basic sociological concepts and turned them into more philosophical. He makes you think deeper and outside the box. You need to take good notes, his slides aren't the best. His exam was tough, but if you asked questions and studied, you'll do fine. His paper was tough too!",2017-08-01 17:52:31
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI3005,"Amazing lecturer! Lecture's very insightful, engaging and informative. Doesn't put up written slides be prepared to take notes. Always available to help.

Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI3005,Best prof I've had in my 4 years. Expects students to engage in the course + the material but doesn't give assignments that are too hard. Good at synthesizing complex material. Students always want to chat with him & he takes time to do this. The last few classes weren't worth grades but almost everybody showed up anyway which speaks for itself.,2017-04-30 10:07:18
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI2010,Good professor but for a class that many take as a joke it was overly tough (marking wise). Go to class and pretend you care and you'll be fine.,2017-04-11 18:38:47
Ariel Fuenzalida,ANTH3310,Im currently taking this class.  He is the best professor I've had at Carleton thus far.  His lectures and his delivery are engaging and everyone that I know in the class completely agrees.  His development of every topic is deep and he has a great understanding of everything he teaches.  He also allows for a lot of commentary from the students.,2016-11-08 20:52:31
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI3050,Awesome professor to have! Ariel really cares about his students. This was a fairly average course. If you show up to class and pay attention you will do well on the exams and the papers are generally graded pretty fairly - just watch grammar as he is a stickler for it. Great lectures as he is dynamic and engaging in class.,2016-06-28 15:15:35
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI2005,Great teacher. Dr. Fuenzalida is very well educated in the topic of social theories and has a great explanation to help students understand as well. He takes time to thoroughly explain the important social theories of classical theorists as well as post modern ones. There is mandatory reading and it is very important to do the online work.,2016-04-23 13:01:32
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI2001,"The lecture material could be interesting, but his delivery lacks. He expects students to post online around 50 times during the semester (as an approximation). Your mark for online postings is graded by how many other people post, so if you don't think you can spare the extra hours, you will miss 10% of your grade. ",2015-04-05 15:20:05
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOC2101,"1 Midterm, 3 short assignments, 1 final. All long answers. Exams are based solely on textbook, so definitely make sure to study it thoroughly.

Lectures are awesome course requires work but I would definitely recommend this prof!",2014-01-06 20:23:55

Ariel Fuenzalida,SOC2101,"Very helpful professor with sound presentation skills. Written assignments were fair and definitely helped my mark.

Focused a lot on specific aspects (verbatim) out of textbook on exam.",2013-12-13 14:32:03
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI3055,"Such a great prof. If you are ever struggling with anything, go see him in office hours, he is SO helpful, clear and supportive of your ideas and writing. The class can be a bit dry but he's a great lecturer and very passionate. If you put the mark in, you can do really really well in his classes!",2013-01-11 21:35:42
Ariel Fuenzalida,SOCI3055,"Also, the prof who engages students by using videos. Very helpful at office hours. My experience was that most policy students *loved* the course and found it to be a fun and easy bird-course.

Paul Mkandawire,HUMR3504,"Very charming prof, gives 2 weeks to complete assignments but they were not that long or difficult so it's doable if you are good with your time, plus he let us choose between final paper or in class exam. Participation is mandatory&he will call you out if you dont speak in class, but he's always very friendly. He will write you a reference letter",2017-07-10 13:52:14
Paul Mkandawire,HUMR3301,"Paul is nice and charming and he is approachable if your interested in going to his office to chat but if you want to email him don't expect more than a sentence in response. He has the firm belief you should be able to write your 3500 word essay in the span of two weeks, which is why he'll only tell you what your writtting about at that time.",2015-11-11 11:09:42
Paul Mkandawire,HUMR2202,"Paul is a really nice, cool guy. A little intimidating due to hotness. His class is really geared towards his assigned readings and he doesn't mind picking you out to ask you what you think. Do your readings!",2014-05-23 09:26:23
Paul Mkandawire,HUMR3001,"Paul is a genuinely nice guy. He is always willing to help students out and prefers if you just drop by his office instead of e-mailing. For participation marking he is easy because if you just show up to all his classes you get 100%, no need to take part in class discussion to get full marks. He is a fair marker. He likes to make jokes & is young",2014-04-22 20:07:58
Tamara Kotar,PSCI1200,"I found the professor's style of lecture difficult to follow for an intro, slow with lots of unnecessary scribbling on the slides. Lots of general information but nothing specific. As the lectures are pre-recorded, there are no interactions with the prof, just the TA during the tutorials. You could however arrange office hours.",2023-01-03 16:47:40
Tamara Kotar,PSCI1100,"Brutal course, do not recommend it. Prof Kotar explains nothing in her lectures because they are way too theoretical for a first year course, no examples, and impossible to reach, hated taking her class last year, nothing against her personally, just a bad prof.

Tamara Kotar,PSCI1100,"Nice woman, however her lectures were incomprehensible. She uses so many undefined in her lectures to the point that I cannot understand most of the lecture.

I would recommend different prof.",2022-05-27 18:51:28

Tamara Kotar,PSCI1200,"My biggest issue is that in her lecture videos, she puts little-no information on the slides and just TALKS so you have to write down everything she's saying.

She gives really rough assignments, like the academic briefs which are worth 37% of your mark each and are a total of 1200 words each.

Tamara Kotar,PSCI1001,No idea how she has such glowing reviews or if her quality of teaching has gone downhill ever since. She's extremely vague and confusing!

Tamara Kotar,PSCI1100A,"Where do I even start, for the quizzes you don't need the readings just lectures, When writing notes for the lectures write everything she says, her lectures are long and boring and draws random lines to make her points.

Tamara Kotar,PSCI1100A,"She was one of my least fav professors... her assignments left all of her students and my TA confused.

Tamara Kotar,PSCI1100,"Professor Kotar is very knowledgeable, and loves discussing with students. She also treats students with respect, and is willing to give extensions.

I'm usually an A student and did terribly on these.",2021-03-19 19:43:23
Tamara Kotar,PSCI1200,Hard elective for an engineer. Lot's of required readings and essays that are toughly graded. As a professor she is very positive and active but for the fall2020 semester she attended last 5 minutes of discussion groups only and there was no live communication with her. Easier than Eng. courses tho. Better take MUSI or FILM classes as electives,2021-01-12 15:52:17
Tamara Kotar,PSCI1200,"As an engineering student, I really enjoyed this class. Wasn't very hard but readings were time consuming. Big paper at the end but easy to write if you do the readings and go to class. Overall pretty easy course for engineering electives but only if you're literate! Don't take if you don't like reading and writing a lot. Must know your history too",2020-08-31 18:07:30
Tamara Kotar,PSCI1200,"Great prof, passionate and knowledgeable about the course. Really clear grading criteria and easy to get free marks. She can go through material kind of fast and may not delve into detail as much as you might want but that's also probably because it was a general first year course.

Tamara Kotar,HUMR3202,Professor Kotar is probably one of my favorite professors. Clear with how she grades assignments and very easy-going.

Siva Sivathayalan,ECOR1101,"It's hard to say anything positive about Siva, except for his flawless attendance. My PA sessions were more useful to me. Siva made a lot of techniques hard to understand, and he places importance on number-crunching and basic knowledge than the techniques we need to learn. Also, I feel he didn't prepare us enough for the final (midterm was okay).",2014-09-04 19:04:05

Siva Sivathayalan,ECOR1101,I believe this professor was one of the best ones i ever had. He approaches the content in a very consistent and chronological way.

HIS QUESTIONS APPEAR ON EXAMS.,2013-10-31 18:22:43

He has a really strong accent which makes him really hard to understand & even if you can understand him he doesn't make much sense since he doesn't seem to know what he is talking about If you have this prof don't bother going to class you won't learn anything useful.

Sam Dube,MATH1004,"Math3705,Math1005:This guy can entertain a class. He's gotta brain the size of a peanut! talks about pointless stuff. Then in the last five min of class puts up 10 pages of notes on the board and can't even explain them(he will choke without his notes)",2004-04-22 14:49:33
Sam Dube,69105,I guess I'm really dating myself with that 69 course code... Make that MATH 1005 for the youngsters out there.  DUBE IS AWESOME.  I was in the class where we were being taught by the Lebanese Math Nazi (LMN) and protested until the department gave us Dube,2004-04-14 06:23:24
Sam Dube,CALC10045,"Make sure you register in Dube's section. Math 1005 is pretty hard, but it's a lot more bearable with such an awesome prof. His lectures are entertaining and he gives excellent, organised notes.",2004-04-06 12:47:41
Sam Dube,MATH1005,"Conveys difficult material clearly, without being overbearing or condescending. Also relatively entertaining. For new students, if he teaches a course you need, I'd recommend setting up your schedule around his section of the course - it's worth it!",2004-03-17 23:17:37
Sam Dube,MATH3705,this man spends too much time entertaining hampster heads in class and not enough time teaching.  He wastes large amounts of time telling pointless stories that just arnt funny then rushes through the material to catch up.,2004-03-13 10:41:07
Sam Dube,MATH1005,"Amazing guy, really really helpful and great.  Everything people say about him is true, hes alot of fun!  If you can get only ONE prof to fit in your schedule, make it him!",2004-03-02 20:10:26

Sam Dube,69105,He's nice.,2001-10-10 00:30:23
Sam Dube,69105,Very Resonable teacher that looks out for students rather than school authority.,2001-09-11 00:13:24
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH101,Totally science based psych course.  Just listening to lectures were not enough.  You had to read the text and use the Ace-It to get anywhere.,2011-06-26 21:59:16
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,Great guy. Too bad he's retired.,2009-03-20 11:55:13
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1000,"This guy is awesome, and the class is not boring at all.He is so funny,he's always insulting the slackers and they don't even notice.It's a survey course so there is a lot of info.Use ACE-IT,and read the text before class and you'll do fine.The most memorable prof I've had.",2008-07-21 03:16:41
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1002,Ok so he is completly unorganized... he doesn't use WebCT or any powerpoint he uses overheads!!! OVERHEADS!!! << Way behind the times. IMPORTANT!!! BUY ACE IT!!!! STUDY ALL OF THE PRACTICE QUESTIONS AND YOU WILL ACE THE EXAM!!! <<< most of the questions are EXACTLY the same!!!!!! He is very boring and he rambles on about birds and animals!!,2008-07-16 09:15:55
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1002,"Not the best psyc prof, but alright. Certainly bearable. Go to the lectures, but read the heck out of the textbook first. The slides make no sense without context, so write notes. Shop around for Psyc profs before you register for his class, there are some excellent ones.",2008-07-01 12:55:39
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,"He is a scientist not a social-psychologist. So I recommend him for those who are interested in science. If you try you will do well. The ACE-it CD was awesome help. I still remember most of what I learned, even his cheesy stories/tangents. (I guess he's that good).",2008-04-15 21:08:28
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH1002,Boring and hard to understand and sit through his lectures. I regret taking the class.,2008-02-28 00:16:35
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,Material can be difficult to understand if you dont go to class. The ACE-IT program provided is a huge help - definately the reason i did well in the class. 75% of exam questions were taken word for word from the program that the prof designed himself - those that werent were no big surprise because they were writte in the same format,2007-12-15 21:47:14
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1002,"Lectures drift off-topic pretty much every class, which made it difficult to pay attention throughout the whole class. Exams are made to trick you and made the entire experience very frustrating.",2007-05-03 16:25:55
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,Mc Intire has changed his exams as of this year. He took a year off and in that time made it change. Acid is no longer the soul basic of the exams and old exams. He is a nice guy but its a hard course. He had to bell curve our exams. Our class average was on one exam was 56. Just think about that when your choosing him as a prof.,2007-04-18 13:58:25
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,Just great!,2007-03-17 12:17:16
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,Lecture attendence is mandatory!!! ACE-IT should be use as reference if you want to learn the material and do well in future courses. PASS is useless.,2007-03-10 15:59:56
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1002,"I also had him for PSYC1001 and he's been awesome at both. He's very smart, knows how to bring it down to our level and you actually come out of the class feeling like you've LEARNT something. Totally take his class - you won't regret it.",2007-03-08 15:19:57
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,"This guy is a legend, he is the only reason I managed to squeeze out an A+ in this class. You really have to go to class and get the Ace-It CD, a lot of the exam questions come from Ace-It, but you will not pass unless you go to class...some lectures don't even have corresponding textbook chapters so you'll miss a lot. Very interesting prof!",2007-01-08 22:47:16
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,Easiest course I've taken at Carleton. Don't bother going to the lecture. Just know the ace-it and see if u can get his old tests that are floating around. He takes about 90% of his questions from ace-it and old tests.,2007-01-02 02:45:23
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,"Very thourough,  class is video recorded, it helps,  very interesting stuff",2006-12-11 23:40:48
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1000,omg- I cannot believe anyone thought he was good- this is not a science course...i hated him as a prof- he is conceited and does not care about what the students think. The worst prof i had in my entire university career. he thinks he's good which is allowed- but he's so bad in reality. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM- if you care about passing...,2006-12-06 18:12:46
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,A great professor who simplifies things that would otherwise be difficult and complicated to understand. This Prof. really knows what he's talking about and creates a class that one looks forward to going to every week. 3 hours of class seems like 10 minutes with this professor.,2006-09-23 17:18:15
Dan McIntyre,PSYC10011002,"He is a wonderful prof, and very funny. Adds in stories about his family or research basically every class, but it makes it interesting! PSYC 1001 is harder, simply because it is the more biological section. Exams are fair, but BUY THE ACE-IT CD. You'll do much better that way!",2006-07-29 13:06:36
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,He's one of those guys you either love or you hate. I've yet to meet anyone in the middle. I thought he was awesome. I learned a great deal from his lectures and I found his sense of humor and constant joke-cracking to make 3 hours not only bearable but exciting (I looked forward to class). He's also a freakin' genius.,2006-04-16 08:31:43
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH1001,You couldn't ask for a more knowledgable man to lay the groundwork for your psych degree. He is unbelievably smart and shares some of the funniest stories about his family. I wonder if they get mad at him? I hope he never retires. He was the inspiration for my entire degree. I highly recommend sitting in his class. You won't be sorry.,2006-04-01 15:40:01
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH1001,"I've only watched him on DVD but there's no question this guy is scary smart. Sometimes he goes into HUGE detail very fast, but you are learning from the best.",2005-12-14 13:03:13
Dan McIntyre,101,"your a retarded queef if u dont like mcintyre, he is the bomb, easily the reason i get A's in all psych courses is becuase the ground work he laid down in 1st year",2005-12-01 20:55:14
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,This teacher was incredibly boring.  After the first few lectures i stopped going to class because there was no point since i did not get anything out of his lectures.  Best advice i can give you is to study off of his old exams since most of the questions will be almost identical to the ones on your exam.,2005-11-28 13:13:54
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH10011002,A really boring class! He was very hard to pay attention to. Take the class with another prof.,2005-11-13 20:13:51
Dan McIntyre,PSYC10011002,"Very engaging lectures. He's very funny too, and his jokes and stories will keep you awake if you aren't a fan of the biology aspect of the course. Exams questions are straight from the ACE-IT, so mids/finals are extremely easy. And you come out of each lecture feeling like you know a lot more about humans.",2005-08-30 20:33:51
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1002,"I took his class in 1st year. I found his lectures difficult to follow and rather dull. The exam questions took me by surprise; didn't know where they came from. I got A's in all my other psyc classes, but a C in his. I would have done much better if I purchased the ace-it package...make sure you buy it and use it.",2005-08-16 07:35:50
Dan McIntyre,1001,"Class is _very_ biology based, so have some background in science before taking it. He had surgery during the time I took the course and ended up showing lectures from a previous year which didn't cover what he thought they did, so there were questions nobody knew answers to on the midterm (he did boost grades due to this, though).",2005-08-07 09:38:10
Dan McIntyre,1001,"To be honest, I liked Psychology before I took this class and now I hate it. He bored me to death, i stopped going to class and just studies old exams (ONLY OLD EXAMS NO TEXTBOOK NO CLASSES) and I came out with a ""B"". So if you want an easy course this is for you. If you want to enjoy Psychology I reccomend another Prof.",2005-07-21 09:40:34
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1000,Very interesting,2005-05-16 14:08:23
Dan McIntyre,PSYC10011002,awesome prof. easy to understand. presents material in an understandable way.,2005-04-28 22:08:04
Dan McIntyre,PSYC10011002,Excellent teacher who knows his stuff and knows how to present it in a way that makes it super easy to understand...got an A and A+ in his classes.,2005-04-15 14:44:33
Dan McIntyre,10011002,"Interesting class, but boring. McIntyre is relitively inanimate other than his hand-movements. It's better to study off old exams, or Ace-it than off of lecture materal as the course hasn't changed in years.",2005-03-05 13:08:43
Dan McIntyre,10011002,"Very good teahcer, gets into some material out of the first year criteria, but he explains everything in a way that is easy to understand.  One of the more entertaining profs I've had so far...",2005-02-27 16:01:50
Dan McIntyre,10011002,"You need the ACE-IT cd to pass his class, otherwise the questions don't seem to come from anywhere. He knows his stuff, but presents it in a way thats beyond 1st year level",2005-01-30 19:06:13
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH1001,"Horrible teacher, exams are not from lecture or textbooks but exams from previous years. Boring lectures that put me to sleep - YAWN!!",2004-12-17 09:35:22
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1000,"the exams are horrible. i dont know where the info came from. the lectures are interesting but not helpful for the exam. he gets off topic a lot, although the stories are interesting.",2004-12-12 00:15:37
Dan McIntyre,PSYCHO1000,"he has a tendency to digress form time to time,but his infomation is very relevant, and his classes are fun. even though i fall asleep sometimes.",2004-12-10 18:10:24
Dan McIntyre,PHSYC1001,"how much you study is totally irrelevant to the grade you get. its based on luck. lectures are hard to follow. on the bright side, it's not a lot of work.",2004-12-10 08:06:38
Dan McIntyre,PSYC10012,"World-renowned epilepsy specialist. Tons of useful info., if you're a great note taker, you'll do well since 80-85% of the exam q'ns are derived from the lectures. A wonderful intro. to psychology for the serious student who intends to learn. Not recommended for slackers. Ace-it isn't recessary!",2004-11-04 00:17:20
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1001,What a horrible teacher!!! His lectures put me to sleep and he rarely follows the lecture notes he puts online. His exams are extremely difficult and he barely gives out any help or clues or anything. Turned me off the subject completely.,2004-10-27 19:30:14
Dan McIntyre,PSYCH1001,"the ace-it cd only helps those who take his ITV course in the summer with that hippy lookin' guy... hippy guy's summer itv course exam's mostly ace-it questions, exact copies. ;)",2004-10-25 16:24:06
Dan McIntyre,PSYC1000,"Not easy to get ahold of. Great course. ACE-IT is not really as useful as they say, but it does help. Take good notes. Oh, and copy the data files off the ACE-IT floppy BEFORE you install it, and then reload those later. Then you can install it more than twice. It doesn't work on a mac, either. Grr.",2004-10-25 02:36:46

Y.A. Bennett,HIST2803A,Lectures were kind of useless but they were still interesting to go to and were helpful for essays. The essays were a little difficult but they were pretty interesting to research and write. YAB and the TA were really helpful pointing me in the right direction when researching and providing feedback.,2019-07-07 22:15:34
Y.A. Bennett,HST480,"I've never tried so hard in a class before, just to waste an entire year. She wouldn't even mark my final paper and tried to convince me to write a brand new 20 page paper in the last week of school, forcing me to drop my honours to a general history degree. I feel so disappointed by the lack of support and effort she gave me.",2018-04-11 13:41:52
Y.A. Bennett,HIST2803A,"okay prof, very helpful with feedback and responds clearly and quickly to emails and questions about assignments. Not difficult to do well in her class but her lectures are hard to sit through. Lectures are all over the place and on a word document so very unorganized and impossible to view. Jumping around of topics makes note taking impossible",2018-03-21 15:13:00
Y.A. Bennett,HST480,"I've never had a difficult time in school until now. I'm talking near weekly emotional breakdowns, constant reminders that she doesn't believe I'm at a university level which is quite interesting, being fourth year and this the first time a prof has said this to me. Her assignments are totally unclear, she dominates research topics in a terribleway",2018-01-24 09:47:47
Y.A. Bennett,HIST2803A,Her lectures were scattered. Her notes were on a Microsoft word document with over 30 pages and only get through 15. Assignments were confusing and didn't give much information on what was expected (3-5 sentences of direction) and when asked for further clarification about the assignment she would just repeat exactly what the description said.,2017-08-02 16:56:16
Y.A. Bennett,HIST2803A,"A good professor. Has deep knowledge on what shes talking about. Very passionate. Research papers are really hard, you need to put a lot of work in.

Y.A. Bennett,HIST1002,"LITERALLY an angel prof! Her lectures consist of her just talking so u rlly have 2 be selective and wise with your note-taking.

Overall, she's so caring and helpful and the only prof u'll probs have that will remember your name!",2017-06-01 23:04:43
Y.A. Bennett,HIST1002,The most caring professor you'll probably ever have! She's so accommodating and is more than willing to assist you outside of class. She's quite the historian so her assignment expectations are reasonably high. This isn't a bird course so follow instructions and you'll be fine. She also tells u what to expect for both exams! I highly recommend her!,2017-05-28 13:31:08
Y.A. Bennett,HIST2802,Bennett is a very caring professor. She is interested in the material and interested in the work you produce for her class.

Y.A. Bennett,HIST2802,"Wonderful! Although some of the course material was dry, her lectures made it interesting. Super approachable and makes an effort to really get to know students.

She really does care for her students to the extent she will send out emails daily just reminding us that she is here if we need help or want to talk. She also does an incredible job of getting to know each student individually which is very hard in a class of 200.,2015-12-08 02:06:45
Y.A. Bennett,HIST1002,"Engaging lectures, interesting assignments (sometimes with vague instruction, but generally if you demonstrate that you engage with the material you'll attain a solid mark).

Y.A. Bennett,HIST2801,Bennett really does care about her students and this shows through her office hours and availability. Her asignments are simple but require time commitment.

Learned a lot from her, and after 3 years on campus she still remembered my name and details about conversations when I had her class. She cares about students",2008-11-26 23:20:45

Y.A. Bennett,AA,"It has been almost 20 years since I took her claass and she still cares. I spoke to her recently and she is still an amazing Teacher.

Y.A. Bennett,HIST4802,A wonderful prof! She expects the best from her students (tough). But she is always available to help. The readings were interesting. The student presentations in the second term were the highlight. It's an actual seminar/peer led learning adventure. My only complaint: You're force fed the British press as a source for the class is Anglo-centric.,2008-04-24 12:17:31
Y.A. Bennett,HIST2801,"Bennett is very available to help her students and very caring. That being said, her lectures are horribly boring and it is completely impossible to take notes.

Y.A. Bennett,HIST1002,I found she cared a lot about students success..however at her lectures I found it difficult to take notes as what she was saying was never repeated and she did a lot of rambling off topic about stuff that wont show up on an exam but she is helpful if you go and talk to her!

Tom Darby,PSCI2301A,"Tom Darby is the biggest beauty in the tiny microcosm of a queef that is Carleton University.  Do not transcend his boundaries or he might send you down to the Pyrheaus, where you will co-penetrate with Glaucon, son of Ariston.",2016-12-03 18:33:26
Tom Darby,PSCI2301A,"Absolutely unreal professor. Kind of intimidating at first, doesn't use technology for the class and is asking us questions in the first class.

He makes the subject easy & fun",2016-04-18 20:37:16
Tom Darby,PSCI2301,"So many people told me to avoid his course, and I'm so glad I didn't listen. I think Professor Darby is an acquired taste, but if you listen and put in the work the course really is a breeze. His lectures may not use slides and he may not post on CuLearn, but that's because he doesn't need to. If you show up and listen you'll be more than fine.",2016-03-31 17:17:08
Tom Darby,PSCI2301,"Tom was a sweet man. He may come off as intimidating but when you meet and talk with him he is a joy to have around.

Show up, read, and ask questions.",2016-03-20 19:48:10

Tom Darby,PSCI2301A,"Tom Darby was an excellent professor. Although he did not use CuLearn, that did not affect the course at all. That being said, participation at lectures was essential, and especially in tutorials as 30% was allotted for it. The only downside is that the paper and exam were at the end of the course, therefore, you do not know any grade until the end",2015-12-16 19:08:14
Tom Darby,PSCI2301A,Professor Darby was a fantastic lecturer. He makes you learn. His repetition of important terms makes you realize themes and ideas in the readings that you never saw before.

Tom Darby,PSCI2301,Darby is tough to follow in his lectures and just rants the whole time. Doesn't put up lecture slides either. When you take notes make sure you keep up. He is passionate about philosophy but he teaches the course like it is a masters course when it is a second year course. ,2015-12-07 20:39:52
Tom Darby,2301A,Very nice to his students. His lectures are a little confusing and sometimes tough to follow. Get ready to take lots of notes as there are no slides. I'm amazed at how he draws perfect circles on the chalk board though...,2015-11-07 16:44:37
Tom Darby,PSCI2301,"Put it this way, if you don't go to class you really won't pass. His lectures are only an hour long and they go by fast however his clarity is confusing. I often found myself getting lost in the middle of his lecture because he switches from topic to topic. There is no lecture slides either so be prepared to take lots of notes and read.

Tom Darby,PSCI2301A,"Doesn't post lecture slides, nor does he use any in class. Lectures consist of hour long rants with little to no guidance on what the lecture is covering. Beyond these short comings, he is very passionate about his area of study, and has great insight into the topic at hand, but could use a kick-in-the-rear to use more modern teaching methods.

Tom Darby,PSCI2300,This professor is very difficult to understand. It was hardly ever clear what the main idea of a lecture was. He treated the course almost purely as a philosophy course so it was VERY metaphorical and unclear. I went to every classlistened intently but I found I was always very confused. He should probably retire so lives can be saved. ,2015-06-01 15:48:29

Tom Darby,2300PSCI,Very lazy professor. He's floating around in his own world and presents the entire course as some kind of story. You won't understand the course content until the final week when everything links together. He uses lofty terms and yells for no apparent reason. I found more clarity and understanding in my tutorials then in the lectures.,2013-02-12 18:46:40

Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"Professor Darby is a legend in his own right. He can speak and read Ancient Greek, and knows Socrates better than Socrates himself.

Tom Darby,PSCI2003,"Although I did fairly well in this class, I ascribe it to having to go the extra-mile to understand course material (former students, other sites). He does not use WebCT.

Tom Darby,PSCI2300,Great prof and is very helpful if you ever have any questions. It is absolutely critical that you attend every lecture though and read every reading otherwise it would be very difficult to understand what he's trying to explain.

His lectures are understandable if you are constantly concentrating but are so boring that you don't even want to concentrate. He is a nice man, but this course for a first year is hell.

Tom Darby,PSCI1001,"Very smart and a good speaker. Not ideal for first year students though - his lectures were very complex and probably better suited for 4th year students. For first year it was a bit overwhelming and he really didn't seem to care, he just did it his way.",2010-07-04 16:43:32
Tom Darby,PSCI1001,"The most I've learned in a half credit course. If you have no interest in political theory it may be boring, but overall he's worth listening to.

Tom Darby,PSCI4305,"While I can see reasons not to take courses with him if you're not into political theory or are in your first few years, he provides a very clear and thought out teleology based around Kojeve's understanding of Hegel.

Tom Darby,PSCI1001,Absolutely ridiculous and holds a very warped view of the world. Yells angrily with every word and proves himself to be a very unhappy man.

Lots of books to buy and just all around pointless and HARD.,2010-03-03 22:40:34
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"An amazing professor that will change your life if you understand him. He's funny, witty, helpful and most importantly speaks with a think Georgia accent. The course is unfortunately very difficult and you will either love it or hate it.",2009-04-21 01:01:12
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"Dr.Darby's class will force you out of your comfort zone. This course proves that theory can be provocative, radical, uplifting and revolutionary. Dr.Darby is very caring and helpful, if you are willing to make the effort. Excellent course; reshaped my educational path.",2009-02-23 22:56:07
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,Worst prof I have ever had. In a class that is geared towards understanding the evolution of political thought and philosophy the most important focus should not be the prof's opinion or his own cooked up theories. Makes waking up for class a nearly impossible chore.,2008-12-21 22:29:17
Tom Darby,PSCI2003,"Awesome teacher the best in the school for sure! He is very passionate about his work and he knows what he is talking about, if you like philosophy this prof is a must",2008-11-29 18:28:22
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"I'd wager he tries his best to grind down your grade as low as he can with the deadly essays he assigns - so it's best to stay on your toes and attend EVERY class. You might like his style if you're a scholar of philosophy, otherwise you'll find he does a terrible job of relating the material to you.",2008-11-28 05:05:10
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"Amazing teacher. He takes his time with the material which is a good thing, because the material is dense. He really drives the important points and beats them into your head. I love going to his lectures, they are like a play. He gets so passionate with his teaching. If it was anyone else teaching this boring stuff I would have dropped it.",2008-10-24 12:05:42
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,The whole focus of this course is not to teach students about the ideas of various philosophers themselves (as the course title would suggest) but rather to indoctrinate still impressionable students with his own warped idea of philosophy.  The conclusion to this course was embarrassing: we are headed towards a Clash of Civilizations. Honestly.,2008-06-16 11:51:08
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,By far the worst prof I have ever had.  TA worshiped him like he is a god.  Makes you write the same essay in both term - if you don't write it as he would you'll bomb it big time.  He will make you loath political theory as he teaches nothing resembling it.   You'd be better off taking this class with Prof MacLean.,2008-04-23 19:13:07
Tom Darby,PSCI2100,The essay is extremly difficult if you have not done the readings.,2008-04-05 17:27:50
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,Darby doesnt teach the class well at all.  He is far too reliant on the books in class and does a terrible job making sense of them.,2008-03-26 01:08:58
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"He is a nice person, but there is just too much reading and not enough time.",2007-09-26 23:53:27
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"The Darbs rocks.  Originally from Savannah Georgia, never afraid to tell you what he thinks of all the philosophers we're learning about, do not miss his lectures, they are one of the few I actually look forward to going to.  He shouts the entire lecture and gets animated.  Probably my favorite professor ever.",2007-03-07 03:12:54
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"Really enjoyed this professor, brought a definite clarity to the subject, interesting text selections provided great backup to the picture he drew.",2007-01-11 21:57:37
Tom Darby,PHSOMETHING,"There is a reason 'the darbs' has a bust of plato in his office; the resemblence is more than merely physical... and he cultivates it to the best of his ability. Very much interested in creating a group of acolytes, but a very intelligent man, and a good and never boring professor",2006-01-30 09:57:28
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"He was put there for a reason; he filters thru b.papmer's, hence why ppl are so afraid of him.  But he is very smart; of course, he's stuck in his own world, but he indirectly taught me to think for myself and defend my beliefs.  don't be afraid to personally disagree with the man; he is only one side of the coin. loved this class!",2005-07-18 23:02:29
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,I hate this prof. He completely ruined my BPAPM experience and I only hope future generations of bureaurats will be spared from this neocon hack.,2005-03-03 12:23:27
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Clearly a smart man but needs to realize that first year students ARENT at his level of understanding of the topic.  Far too vague about his points and needs to tone down the abstract in his lectures, glad the class is over",2004-12-29 03:35:06
Tom Darby,PAPM,I HATE!!! THIS MAN!!!  BUT IF YOU GET DENIS OR GRAHAM AS TA'S UR GOOD TO GO,2004-12-15 22:34:51
Tom Darby,BPAM1000,This class almost scared me out of BPAM when I took it.  Confusing and scary for little first years.  The stuff we learned would make sense to me now (in 4th year) but was waaaay too confusing in 1st year.,2004-08-21 17:09:52
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"If you get what he's saying, then he's amazing.",2004-08-20 14:32:13
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"BRILLIANT!! Love how he is able to truly offer a fresh perspective on the material he is teaching. At times what he is talking about, or trying to get at can be very confusing-but once you understand you appreciate the unique approach. Really gets you thi",2004-08-16 02:26:03
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"Brilliant man, apparently. Doesn't care much about his lectures: they are disorganized and he generally gets his points across by shouting and banging on the table. Reduces philosophers to simplistic generalizations to support his ""thesis"". Avoi",2004-07-14 23:31:25
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,****! This guy is the most arrogant and demeaning man I have ever met. He ruins BPAM for far too many first years. His lectures are convoluted and abstract. When he is asked to clarify he fails.,2004-05-28 14:39:27
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Interesting class, you hate it until the end because you are completely lost until it ties together. Very little guidance throughout though, and if you get Jonathan for a TA, RUN!",2004-04-22 23:29:38
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"You either love him or hate him, he's smart but can be overbearing",2004-04-22 14:55:18
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"A professor clearly uninterested in things as mundane as organizing lectures, checking his exam instructions for questions on books we haven't read or giving any kind of instruction for a 12-page paper. Too busy trying to make publication deadline?",2004-04-15 16:06:50
Tom Darby,PSCI2300,"The best Proff I've ever had. The course may not seem to make sense, but remember the course is an argument. Thus it only makes sense in its totality. Basically a cumulative effect is seen at the end of the course, bit like a movie. Extremely approachable",2004-04-07 17:19:27
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Very entertaining class, but completely over your head until the last week, when it all comes together.  Vince should be a prof, he lectures like Darby.",2004-03-26 09:56:07
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,Colonel Sanders meets Santa Claus--that's what this man is.He can be argumentative and mean.He dwells too much on classics-- less time for other important topics.Won't bore you though-Smart man.Hope Alex is your T.A.,2004-03-17 22:07:45
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Although highly intelligent, has difficulty structing classes and expressing material effectively. Argumentitive if he disagrees with your opinions",2003-12-17 14:44:29
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Excellent prof who knows his classics and moderns. He is VERY clear on what he says and will answer questions, but don't try arguing because he'll tear you apart.",2003-12-10 13:28:50
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Considering the difficulty of the course material, the professor does a good job outlining the main points. However, he is somewhat intimidating.",2003-10-30 09:44:12
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Admitted, his course was allover the place. However, it was easy to sit through and always had a couple of laughs. The ammount you get out of it probably depends on your TA.",2003-10-01 09:53:19
Tom Darby,PSCI23000,"He is one of the best teachers that I have ever had. He makes thing clear and gets his point across , no matter how many times he has to say it.",2003-08-06 18:23:56
Tom Darby,47435,"you really would think that by the time a prof gets to this level of teaching, his communication skills would atleast be minimal - apparently not.",2003-06-12 22:21:41
Tom Darby,47435,"Worst prof ever.  He's rude and petty when you don't agree with his ideas.   Classes are muddled, often off topic, and unstructured.  He had some people prepare presents, then cancelled them,making them prepare another.  Reading list changed every week.",2003-06-12 21:02:17
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,He took us DOWN to the Piraeus.  Good job.,2003-04-26 14:17:17
Tom Darby,PAPM1000,"Incredible content and course organization. Our class was constantly pressed for time, which didn't do justice to the authors of such intense content.",2003-04-08 23:07:59
