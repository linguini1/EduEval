Andrew Meyertholen,PHYS2B,"Great Professor, great sense of humor. As a person who has always been scared to take physics, this class was interesting and fun. Yes some quizzes were difficult, but I think it is fair for the most part. I just wish he would give more credit to homework.",2019-06-13 16:22:15
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"My favourite prof so far! Excellent teaching, he explains everything very clearly and answers everyone's questions. Tests are also very fair. Even if you think you do not like physics, take his course and you will change your mind! Plus his sense of humour is adorable",2018-09-14 17:00:35
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY131,One of the best professor I have had at u of t. His lectures are easy to follow and his tests are completely reasonable (and should be easy if you studied).,2018-07-28 17:55:18
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,He is well-prepared to class. The lecture is fun and easily understood.,2018-06-05 21:20:09
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,His lectures and listening to his voice would be the most soothing moments of your university life especially if you like physics. He also curves the test scores up even if the average is in the high 60s.,2018-05-21 18:46:00
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Great to converse with. Clear, and easy tests!",2018-04-26 19:41:06
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Really good prof. Very kind and accessible out of class. I really enjoyed the simple demos in class instead of simply dumping theory on us and saying ""it works btw"". I really like the approach taken for teaching the class and he is very understanding. Loved Physics with him, I'd definitely consider taking more physics courses with him.",2018-04-14 01:56:43
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"I would have this guy read me the physics textbook to sleep, he's so soft.",2018-03-12 13:20:08
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Loved this class. I was hesitant to take this class but when i found out that Andrew was the prof it was a no-brainer. I honestly loved this class it was my favourite class that i took in second year. He actually cares about his class and in order to make the lectures fun he takes break and puts up fun slides. One of the best and most caring profs,2018-03-07 20:45:44
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"My favourite prof i had at UofT. Not only is he caring and wants his class to do well but he's also really passionate about what he teaches. Also it is evident that he puts in a lot of effort to help the students since he makes pre-class videos that are extremely useful. If you watch those videos and pay attention in class, you will do well.",2018-03-07 20:42:27
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"SO caring and wants his students to do well. Really easy to reach outside of class for office hours or even one-on-one help. I'm not a physics-inclined student, but he makes it easy to understand the material and to have fun. Also a hilarious and great guy.",2018-02-28 17:09:15
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Kind on grades, test questions are just slightly more tricky.",2018-02-14 11:43:24
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,The best beast,2017-12-03 20:24:00
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Probably best professor in UofT. Best quantum mechanics I've ever had.,2017-10-21 22:24:00
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,Awesome prof! It's amazing how he took the effort to care for every student for a class size as big as this. He reviewed questions posted in every online quiz and went through some of them in class. Exam questions were fair and as long as you do the past tests. Definitely one of the best profs I've had!,2017-07-16 11:20:04
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,Andrew was the most caring and attentive prof I had first year. He explained topics thoroughly and gave frequent breaks to digest the information. He was always around to help students after class too.,2017-07-08 19:53:07
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Really great professor, very clear when explaining concepts, always tried to answer any questions we had. Tried to keep his class engaged. Love the pre-class videos he makes. Also, you really see how he tries to make an effort in helping his students. I would really recommend taking any of his classes because he is simply amazing",2017-05-25 22:02:37
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Really a nice professor and he had great lectures. Pre-class videos made the course easier and more accessible,2017-03-18 16:43:09
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,I love him! he's so nice and makes physics class interesting.,2017-03-13 19:37:48
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Most effort I've ever seen a prof put into a course. Very good.,2016-11-29 15:14:00
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Great prof, demonstrates concepts excellently and provides excellent examples. Would recommend the textbook for further examples and instruction, though not entirely necessary. Practicals are a mixed bag but certainly bearable.",2016-09-17 13:06:34
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,Very helpful out of class and in class. Pre-class videos were concise and helped a lot.  His demo's were interesting. He even took us students out for lunch!,2016-06-27 18:59:27
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,"Absolutely the best prof I've ever had at U of T. His pre-class videos and super helpful, he's always willing to meet with students outside of class for further clarification on the material, and he explains concepts in an easy to understand way. He's amazing!",2016-04-14 19:38:41
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY256,Very helpful and approachable. Always makes himself available to you. Cares a lot about being a good instructor and it shows.,2016-04-05 16:21:41
Andrew Meyertholen,PHY132,He's cool. I like him. 10/10.,2016-02-22 12:29:47
Benjamin Wald,PHL281,"The professor himself is fine, teaching methods are terrible. Doesn't explain concepts clearly and expects you to just know it. Lack of communication means TAs have different expectations, making it very difficult to score well on essays. Grading rubrics are useless as it is assessed holistically and categories are assigned marks to fit the grade.",2020-04-22 21:51:55
Benjamin Wald,PHL281,"Constantly says ""you know"" while explaining concepts, as if we already knew the concept. Instructions & rubric for papers EXTREMELY unclear, marking by TAs harsh & unfair. TAs & prof had diff expectations & would often give conflicting instructions. No communication w/ students when things went online for COVID. Took 3wks to return grades.",2020-04-09 19:01:46
Benjamin Wald,PHL281,"I found if you did all the readings & took notes, and were paying attention during lectures, you would pass. I found the TA/tutorial instructor to be an overly-anal grader, who could have gone a bit easier when docking marks. Prof Wald read off the slides so it wasn't necessary to attend lectures. Very reading heavy, but interesting. He is kind.",2020-04-08 19:38:04
Benjamin Wald,PHL344,"Professor Wald is seriously one of the most caring professors ever! An angel in disguise on this earth. He's super understanding, and the content of the course, while tough to understand sometimes, is made more clear by him",2019-12-17 20:56:13
Benjamin Wald,PHL271,"Readings were dense, but his powerpoints outlined them extremely well. However, he'd focus on one point/example for an extended period of time which resulted in rushing the rest of the lecture in the last 5-10 minutes and, he read directly from the slides with barely any additional information. Assignment expectations were clear and fair.",2019-07-10 22:54:17
Benjamin Wald,PHL271,"Professor Wald was great! Super approachable outside of class, and definitely willing to go out of his way to meet with you and make sure you understand the concepts. Assignments required meticulous preparation though.",2019-04-10 01:06:52
Benjamin Wald,PHL271,Grading criteria were always extremely unclear. Concepts were hardly discussed with greater detail than what was written on the slides posted.,2019-04-10 00:16:19
Benjamin Wald,PHL271,"Class has so much offer, but lacks explanation for key understanding. There is a lot of reading and do it yourself, and therefore causes a lot of confusion. Would probably take this course again with a different professor that does not read off the slides majority of the time and rants on one specific example and then tries to rush at the end.",2019-02-25 19:42:21
Benjamin Wald,PHL271,In PHL271 he attempts to use the Socratic Questioning method- uneffectively. He just comes off as annoying. I understand why the Greeks sentenced Socrates.,2019-01-24 17:30:02
Benjamin Wald,PHL380,"Great professor, had two classes with him and both were fantastically interesting. His classes are definitely not bird courses, but they're not unfair either. Very funny, very open minded, loves discussing with the class. I think he's definitely in my top 3 favourite teachers at U of T.",2018-10-22 17:32:43
Benjamin Wald,PHL380,"Loved Ben. Funny and entertaining lectures, a really kind and approachable instructor. Not a speck of arrogance.",2018-04-25 01:47:13
Benjamin Wald,PHL380,Great lecturer! Really helped my understand concepts in the course.,2018-04-19 13:46:56
Benjamin Wald,PHL395,"Extremely harsh marker, doesn't really explain concepts well in class. Not recommend for anyone who hasn't taken that many philosophy classes.",2017-12-15 20:31:56
Benjamin Wald,PHL380,"Nice guy, approachable, really great insights into material. Would take again!",2017-10-13 14:09:22
Katherine Daignault,STA220,"Had to write this review for STA220 since STA288 isn't on the list. This prof does not do a good job at conveying her ideas properly through her lectures. She does a horrendous job at explaining very basic concepts, and goes off on tangents irrelevant for testing. The average for test 1 was 58% for a 2nd year course which says something. Avoid.",2023-03-15 15:49:41
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Prof. Katherine was a fair instructor, organized, clear lectures & provided leniency with 2 no-questions asked extensions for students. Midterm exam was difficult, so prepare well. Assignments & multi-part final project were manageable. Many complain, but she's responsive on question boards & everything balanced, overall good prof for this course!",2023-01-13 01:11:06
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Strict criteria and non-sensical grading expectations baffled me. While the course is relatively straightforward, she cannot communicate her ideas. She is easily offended, and questions are taken as criticism taking up a defensive tone as though we're attacking her character. The course isn't comprehensive, and when asked questions, she's vague.",2023-01-11 19:37:38
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Katherine is an okay lecturer, she explains the concepts clearly. The midterm was fair. A big complaint that I have is about the marking scheme and the structure of the final. The marking scheme is too strict, and while you might feel you met everything, you'll still be penalized. The final project felt too restrictive and not flexible enough.",2023-01-10 03:45:54
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Difficult test & projects, strict grading scheme",2023-01-08 12:30:05
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"If STA302 is your requisite course, AVOID this professor. Please consider taking the course in winter or summer term with other professors. ",2022-12-20 01:19:12
Katherine Daignault,STA302,She is the most awful and most disrespectful prof I have ever seennnnnn. Taking her course is the worst choice I have ever made,2022-12-13 20:36:23
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"worst prof ever seen, donnnnnnnnnn't choose this ***. I am so regretful taking her course. it would be the nightmare of my whole life",2022-12-13 20:34:38
Katherine Daignault,STA302,The most awful professor I have ever seen. Unreasonable marks on projects (She did not even tell us what we should do clearly). ,2022-11-18 23:04:58
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I saw a lot of negative views about her. Of course, she had a crazy amount of homework needed to do, I got about a 45percent before the grades come out, and finally, I got a huge curve up. She will torture you when you take the course, but she also will give you a huge curve when you done the course. Her teaching was clear, not good not bad. ",2022-05-24 21:31:33
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Awful! Avoid at all costs. Does not care much about students. Grading expectations are unclear. ,2022-04-19 18:11:04
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Avoid her if you can.,2022-04-18 22:24:46
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Grading is all over the place.,2022-04-18 22:23:18
Katherine Daignault,STA302,The grading in this course are very inconsistent. She's also terrible at teaching. TAs are also just as incompetent as her!!!,2022-04-18 02:09:02
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Never take a class with her.,2022-04-12 19:20:40
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Way too many assessments ,2022-04-06 06:35:53
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Too many assignments to complete (1-5% each) that requires at least a week of work for each + weekly quizzes that are almost impossible to do. ,2022-04-03 04:06:42
Katherine Daignault,STA302,This professor is by far one of the toughest at UofT. Her tests are very difficult and the rubric for her assignments (which are long and pointless) are unforgiving to any mistakes whatsoever. Avoid this professor if possible as this is the hardest course I've taken at UofT.,2022-04-02 16:09:21
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Too many meaningless but lengthy assessments. Marking is inconsistent,2022-03-12 15:37:50
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Waste your time!!,2022-03-11 20:37:53
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She has absolutely no empathy. I was in hospital and wasn't even given an extension on the midterm. Lectures are completely useless, she just reads off her slides. At least 2 assessments each week, some of them have no takeaways but only to waste your time. She also gives assessments that are due on Sunday and during reading week.",2022-02-20 16:26:21
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Literally the most difficult course I ever took in UofT. Quizzes are insanely hard and lectures do not help at all. Course is filled with thousands of ridiculous graded discussions and assignments. The time commitment required to marginally do good in this course is extremely high. Don't take this course with Prof Katherine and yourself a favour.,2022-02-09 04:30:54
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Unpopular opinion but I think she is not even that bad. I actually learned a lot about data analysis through her 3-part assignments and I didn't think they were that hard, you just have to read the marking scheme carefully. Plus she does curve a lot at the end (course avg is a B-, despite the midterm avg being around 50).",2022-01-27 21:30:52
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Professor Katherine Daignault is not as bad as I thought. She is really caring and always being so kind. Her midterm and quizzes are hard but the workload is not heavy at all.,2022-01-11 01:57:43
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Too many assignments that are packed close to each other. Grading was late making impossible to drop course or CR/NCR before deadline. Only took bc it was a mandatory course. Terrible experience. While prof tries to be nice, way too high requirements. Long assignments and will nitpick. Terrible midterm average and will only ""consider"" curving.",2022-01-06 04:39:14
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Usually never bother to leave reviews but this prof was absolutely horrendous. Worst prof in my entire undergrad, has no respect or empathy and gives 0 f about students and accommodating accessibilities. Horrible human being, I thought I knew what I was going into taking a course with her but holy I was so wrong. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS.",2021-12-25 22:21:17
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Overwhelming slides every week, disorganized lectures and overall course structure. Arbitrary grader. Honestly, the content shouldn't even be that difficult - she just makes it extremely hard to piece everything together so, in the end, your understanding is filled with gaps. Even if you grind at her class, there's a good chance you'll fail. F her.",2021-12-23 18:29:54
Katherine Daignault,STA257,"She is a ppt reader, totally waste of time to attend her lecture. Always made mistakes in quizzes, quite rude to students. Worst professor I have ever seen.",2021-12-21 21:52:30
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Can you believe that she does not allow statistics students to find datasets from Kaggle, UCL machine learning, etc? I have to spend days finding a dataset that satisfies her requirements.",2021-12-11 01:25:39
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She doesn't respect our efforts: 1. just reading slides during lecture time without any explanation. 2. Test and assignment marks are very random, answers write in two pages, she will not check the second page, just give 0 based on the first page. 3. most assignment is useless, test your writing skills, not statistic skills.",2021-12-10 00:14:18
Katherine Daignault,STA302,She has absolutely no sympathy. Takes every suggestion as personal attack. Lectures are basically reading slides and tests are hard. Avoid her if you need the grades,2021-12-09 22:37:54
Katherine Daignault,STA302,Sooooooo many assignments and tests and projects! And we have a midterm that avg is below 60,2021-12-01 19:56:24
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Just dropping here that if we can have a course where the class average for the midterm isn't significantly below 50 for all sections, that would be great thanks.",2021-11-27 22:02:13
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She's a nice, reachable and passionate teacher. However, the course is so work heavy. We have weekly quizzes, in class labs, discussions, midterm, video project, written exercises and final project with multiple parts. She assigned too much work that her team couldn't even manage to mark them.",2021-11-27 02:35:31
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I had to create an account on this website just to express how bad of a prof she is. She packs the lectures with way too much content and gives way too much work. Lots of memorization with little intuitive explanations, so it's extremely difficult to actually get a conceptual understanding. I've had bad profs before, but this is incomparable.",2021-11-11 03:13:23
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"She successfully makes learning statistics boring and difficult, literally read from slides, and all the example questions are like ""1+12"" but the midterm questions are like ""Please solve Russell's paradox"".",2021-10-28 00:23:32
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Although this is a statistics course, KD is good at writing super long slides with text all over it. Prepare to read her fking long slides and around 1.5-2 hours of pre-lecture videos",2021-10-26 01:50:10
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I hate her. Taking 302 with her in the fall rn, we have discussions, in-class labs, tests, a plethora of exercises and assignments split into many parts, and a final project. I don't get why she's making this course so work-heavy. I spend more time on her 3 part assignments than I do on actual important courses, and all that for 5-10% each.",2021-10-17 23:39:37
Katherine Daignault,STA221,Not too bad... very nice and responsive. Her tests are a bit hard but the assignments are extremely easy.,2021-05-01 15:35:01
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"Good lecture videos and relatively understandable assignments, but a brutal midterm under intense time constraints with most questions found nowhere in the lectures.",2021-04-08 23:20:40
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"The midterm for her online course was killer. Unlike any other midterm she or any stats prof has ever written. Her questions are weirdly written and the formulas written were not stuff she taught in class. There were 3 assignments, 1 midterm, 2 ""mini-projects"" (one being a bs recorded presentation), and one final project. So much work!!!",2021-03-17 05:27:34
Katherine Daignault,STA302,"I mean her lectures and Mini Projects are just fine, but the tests are just terrible. The questions are just completely unrelated to the stuff she covered in lectures and everything u reviewed is just useless. I never expect I'm managed to fail the first course in university, the last semester before graduation.",2021-03-09 17:13:24
Katherine Daignault,STA257,Her question is so strange. I understand every word in her question but I dont understand the question. Her ppt content is very simple but the exam content is very complicated,2021-01-16 08:39:08
Katherine Daignault,STA257,Taking this course is the worst experience in uni and I received the worst grade that I have ever got with no surprise. This is the only course I feel like hard-working gains nothing in the end.,2021-01-11 16:43:54
Katherine Daignault,STA257,"This course really require a lot of efforts. I would say the quality of the pre-recorded videos is high. Her lectures are pretty detailed and very helpful for quizzes and exams. I really enjoy learning new statistics knowledges in her class. (The participation requirement is a bit annoying, especially for people living in other time zone like me. )",2021-01-11 16:15:02
Katherine Daignault,STA257,All of her test questions are extremely ambiguous. She takes forever to mark the tests and takes a long time to respond. Has double-standards.,2021-01-09 18:33:32

Katherine Daignault,STA257,"I would be lying if I said I had a remotely fruitful or engaging learning experience from STA257. Quizzes were clearly worded with the sole intention to spark confusion, lectures were simply a regurgitation of the slides and the overall class environment was one in which any wrongdoing could only be on the part of students and not Prof Daignault.",2020-12-24 14:54:58
Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Just don't take this if STA257 is not mandatory. The pre-lecture videos are just reading slides and the lecture is mostly-repeating slides -- but in a faster way. If you do need to take STA257, I recommend you to take the summer section. Tests are really hard compared to what she teaches. Quizzes are time-intensive and need lots of work. GPA killer",2020-12-22 04:17:43
Katherine Daignault,STA257,"Everything she does comes from a good place, and the lectures are quite good, but ""overkill"" might be the most appropriate word to describe how the course is coordinated.

Katherine Daignault,STA257,Why would she not correct the slides in a PRE-RECORDED lecture!? How lazy can one be? Also why would she not post the annotated slides after the lecture is done!? These are just basic things she could improve on apart from the inaccessibility and mediocre lectures. The slides are all empty when you want to review for the exam to cross-check.,2020-12-21 09:30:58

Katherine Daignault,STA257,She clearly put a lot of effort into the class and seemed to care a lot.

Katherine Daignault,STA257,She is unenthusiastic about teaching and does not prioritize students.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Dr. Patterson is a good lecturer; her slides are easy to understand and she explains concepts quite well. However, BCH210 is an INCREDIBLY content heavy course and the tests are very difficult.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Horrible and messy lectures. She never teaches anything relevant for exams making lectures useless to go to. Aher exams are brutal and unfair with 0 curves, tries very hard to screw your mark in the course. Worst professor ever seen. Never ask any questions cuz she uses passive aggresive tone with a disgusted expression on her face. Good riddance",2021-07-07 14:12:10
Sian Patterson,BCH210,She only reads slides in class and gives brutal exams. Worst class ever had at u of t,2021-07-02 01:07:00
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"This is just unbelievable. Worst attitude ever seen, she waste time in class for nothing.. Midterm averages were very low but the professor decided to give a very brutal final exam and curve everyone down. No adjustments were made to the majority of the class even tho many people did very poorly on final exam. Thank you for ending like this",2021-06-30 01:56:37
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Truly the worst professor at uoft. The lectures are hard to follow and all relevant testable information is not on the slides. She failed to properly explain concepts and yet would make the quizzes difficult. The workload was insane: 6 quizzes every week, mandatory tutorial attendance, and biweekly projects. On top of this, she was rude af.",2021-06-12 21:20:24
Sian Patterson,BCH210,one of the worst profs i've ever had. clearly disregards student well being and mental health and refuses to admit there is a marking discrepancy between TA's. any regrade request is marked lower by her so avoid asking in the first place. avoid at all costs,2021-06-07 22:05:33
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"i don't understand all the hate she's getting, she was an amazing prof when i had her. her lectures were clear and organized. people come to university to get a good education not to get easy work. her class is only easy if you ask questions, review daily, and have a good mindset!!",2021-06-03 18:46:17
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Lectures were fine, just a bit boring and confusing. The poor TA had to teach us everything during a 2 hour weekly tutorial. Quizzes you on every little detail. Didn't understand why we had lecture AND weekend quizzes.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I'm taking BCH210 over the summer of 2021 and honestly it isn't that bad. Prof always makes sure to answer your questions on the discussion boards. Yes, she does seem to focus on tiny details in quizzes and BBQs, but fortunately, it's not worth that much. She likes short, packed, lectures, but is usually clear and concise.",2021-05-25 22:19:06
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Going into this course, Prof. Sian Patterson's rating really stressed me out, but looking back, I find that taking the course with her was truly a great experience (especially since you can tell she really wanted you to learn - and I did). In order to get an A, focus more on the learning objectives and actually participate in tutorials. Good luck!",2021-01-14 17:31:36
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Don't take this course. The problem is the TA's. They mark the assignments inconsistently, so if you and a friend have assignments that are very similar, you might get a 10/15 and they get a 14/15. Patterson always sides w/ the TA's and will never acknowledge that they're sabotaging students grades. Your grade is determined by luck, not effort.",2020-12-18 23:18:19
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her lectures were fine... but if you can, wait until this courses is in-person again! The assignments are super long, and mostly unrelated to anything we learn about in class. Not actually testing your understanding of course material, but just how to write long, useless intros about general knowledge. Quizzes were ok but sometimes ambiguous.",2020-12-14 09:38:54

Sian Patterson,BCH210,While her teaching may not be the worst her overall lack of care for students' well-being is incredible.

Her care for mental health is superficial and she expects you to put her class above all else both classes wise and personal life wise.,2020-12-08 17:00:13
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Shes super petty and childish over emails and during office hours she gives you this really false reassurance, saying you just need to know the basic patterns of whats taught in lecture, you dont need to know specifics, but then its like the only way to pass her tests is to memorize every word of every slide.",2020-11-25 21:12:20
Sian Patterson,BCH210,She is rude and cold when you email her. The grading in her class (by TAs or her) is so inconsistent. I got almost perfect one assignment while barely passing another time. This course was challenging and I found it hard to learn the material with her lecture style. Her lectures are short but her assignments and quizzes require more depth.,2020-11-24 06:31:55

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Assignments made up a large portion of the grade , and were relatively fair but has a lot of reading and research.

She can also be pretty rude when you email her so beware",2020-11-05 21:07:36
Sian Patterson,BCH210,Her lectures are not helpful and she rushes through them. She talks as if everyone understands every single word she says and has seen the material before.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Never seen a more universally disliked prof. Inconsiderate, rude, and quite frankly not at all good at teaching anything.

Would not reccomend, can't believe I'm paying for this.",2020-10-14 02:05:10

Sian Patterson,BCH210,AVOID HER! She much more horrible than anything else except the COVID19. We only got 1hour lecture per week and was quizzed on everything and everydetail. You never know what will be on the quiz. And the BBQ question are even worse since they are supposed to be what student can do right after the lecture and in fact they are as ridiculus as quizzes,2020-10-03 12:15:55
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"There's no way she has a 2.5 because she doesn't even deserve a 1. Whatever small detail she says in the lecture, guarantee you it will be on the quiz. Don't bother asking her anything its a waste of your time cuz she'll go out of her way to comment on every little thing to make you feel like the dumbest person",2020-10-01 22:36:20
Sian Patterson,BCH210,Dr. Patterson is quite literally the worst professor I've ever had. Extremely inconsiderate and doesn't care about the success of her students. She refuses to adjust things despite complaints from the entire class and blames lack of studying for not doing well in her class when she doesn't explain concepts properly. AVOID THIS CLASS!,2020-10-01 20:46:47
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Worst class so far, terrible teache has no consideration for her students. The textbook is useless, 4 hours lectures per week normally are condensed to 1 hr per week.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,Worst prof I've had. She has no pedagogy. Her lectures don't match the testing and there's nothing but testing. It's like watching someone drive a car then you're expected to know how to drive on a highway with full traffic right away right away and you're graded for it. There's no opportunity to actually learn anything.,2020-09-21 16:53:51

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"It's quite surprising to see how high her rating is. It should be like 0.25.

Don't ever take biochem with her.",2020-06-22 10:39:44
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"BCH210 online was a mistake. Lectures were rushed and unenthusiastic, and the quizzes were unfairly hard for the time limit.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Online this summer was the second time I got to take the course with Patterson. During the fall in person, the lectures were actually good and she was considerate out of class.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"One of the worst professors I've had at UofT. Her explanations outside of lectures are extremely vague, and she responds to questions in a very condescending manner. Her quizzes are difficult, and contain material that was discussed for less than a minute during lectures. The course is very interesting, she's just unnecessarily difficult.",2020-06-03 20:20:32
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"I get that we, as university students, are responsible for learning the materials. But as a professor, you are responsible for HELPING US LEARN, not screwing us over with insanely hard quizzes and assignments. It feels like I learn more from Google than her. AVOID HER IF YOU CAN.",2020-06-02 19:29:16
Sian Patterson,BCH210,There is a reason why everyone hates her. The lectures are supposed to be 6 hours a week in the summer and since it's online she just decided to give us a 100-minute lecture a week. That's about 10 hours for the whole summer semester. This is supposed to be an introductory course and it's funny how she assumes us to understand biochem in 10 fkn hrs,2020-06-02 19:19:24
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She's just awful. She literally tests you on small details that were mentioned just once in her lectures, so you basically have to write every single word she says. The weekly quiz is a time attack. 10 harsh questions given only 15 minutes. If you politely ask her sth, she just blames on you. Just horrible.",2020-05-25 07:25:51
Sian Patterson,BCH210,THE worst. Unapproachable and when students posted questions she would rudely respond or blame it on us. Someone politely posted if she could disclose the class average for her midterm (it was VERY low and hence wasn't said). She responded with a paragraph about how the student should focus on themselves and if they did bad that's their fault,2020-05-24 23:29:02
Sian Patterson,BCH210,"Her online lecture's so fast-paced and mentions the tiniest details in such a short amount of time. I literally have to pause every five seconds and go back to write things she says down. The quizzes are ridiculously hard compared to what is taught to us. When emailed about this, she gave no sh*t and blamed the student for not studying enough.",2020-05-23 16:16:18

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"While Dr. Patterson does do a good job of making her lectures interesting, it is evident that she rushes through her slides.

Sian Patterson,BCH210,"She's honestly a pretty good professor, she's very good at explaining concepts in a way that helps students understand them easily.

Sian Patterson,BCH311,"Let me just put it this way: she said we didn't need to know any of the material on one of the slides, it was just for our interest.

The midterm and final exam make up over 60% of your mark at every single word, slideshow, and tiny detail he says in a lecture including guest speaker notes are testable. ",2022-11-26 19:52:21
Michael Khan,RSM100,"Turned an easy, informing course into an unnecessary struggle simply to weed out students in year 1. Prof Mike does not do much himself except lecture. Not accessible and simply useless.",2022-10-31 22:25:35
Michael Khan,RSM100,"Mr. Khan is the G.O.A.T! Khan is a chill guy and he wants you to succeed in the course, while everything is testable and can sometimes be boring he does his best to keep you engaged.

Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is pretty funny but tries to make the course unnecessarily hard. Even if you memorize everything from lecture and textbook, he finds ways to deduct marks on tests.

Michael Khan,RSM100,"I took the course in Fall 2019. Michael Khan was an ok prof, he made lectures engaging, but I wouldn't say he was the nicest or most approachable.

Michael Khan,RSM100,"Imagine being a 4.0 student all year until the final exam pulls you down 15 points for no rhyme or reason.

Most of the class is easy, but be ready to worship his every word.",2022-01-17 17:25:42
Michael Khan,RSM100,"Hes a fraud who sells his own textbook to students. Be prepared for easy marks at the beginning of the year, and then have the final drop your score 10-20% for no reason. Memorize every word that comes from his mouth, it will be on the tests.",2022-01-13 17:50:34

Overall, it's not a hard course but required much effort",2022-01-07 19:55:30
Michael Khan,RSM100,The GOAT. Prof Khan is one of the best profs you will have in Rotman first year. Midterms and finals are easy and short if you study correctly.

Michael Khan,MGT100,"MGT100 was a great course, though was based heavily on memorization rather than understanding of concepts.

Do not take the course with him,2021-04-09 01:11:16
Michael Khan,RSM427,"Khan was not a good prof for RSM100. I got him for RSM426, and MY GOODNESS! He is so much better in 4th year. His style of teaching and his extensive and interactive lectures helped us learn more from his one course than anything else I have done in my fourth year. The multiple-choice on his tests is out of nowhere but other than that, very fair.",2021-04-02 00:08:22

Michael Khan,RSM100,"Definitely not my favourite prof but I surely learned a lot from him. He made a really good effort to adjust to online learning.

Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan provided with engaging lectures and lots of case studies but his whole ""everything is testable"" and giving vague instructions was not it.

Michael Khan,RSM427,Took him last year. Terrible prof. One of the descriptions I gave him was 'hilarious' as in hilariously bad. 15% of course mark is on participation with an unrealistic rubric so he will screw you over if you get on his bad side.

Pointless slides, every slide has the word ""inefficiency"" in it. Lectures are not related to any case or MCQ. MCQs are messed up. Cases are long and boring. Worst course ever",2016-03-29 14:21:19

Michael Khan,RSM100,Easily my least favourite professor in first year. Thinks too highly of himself that you feel some sort of barrier between yourself as a student and him. If this course was not a requirement I would have dropped it ONLY because I never feel comfortable at his lectures. He shushes students even if only two people are talking. He seems sharp though,2015-04-16 01:56:53
Michael Khan,RSM427,"This prof is one of those people you have to get to know. He is a very genuine, honest, and friendly guy who likes to be friendly with his students. Very out-of-the-box most of the times, although lectures can be monotonous sometimes due to the dry course subject matter. All in all, great prof. We're very lucky to have him in Rotman.",2015-04-01 23:15:26
Michael Khan,RSM100,"Michael Khan spends a lot of time talking about himself and he spends a lot of time discussing what people review him about. He then talks about how he took his kids to a farm for their birthday. He'll tell you about his summer abroad program.  He is not a  ""level 5 leader"", as he does not seem to take review criticism very well.  Not a real prof.",2015-02-10 11:45:45
Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is annoying as hell. He enjoys himself more than 90% of his students. He talks really fast. His lectures are mostly pointless (but he puts 50% of lecture stuffs on the final exam..) So basically, he forces his students to attend his boring lectures. The WORSE thing is, he is very ""proud' of himself. ",2015-01-20 11:09:33
Michael Khan,RSM100,"He is a good lecturer, I found his lectures to be interesting. Watch out for the exam because he tests on lecture material and in class discussions.

Michael Khan,RSM100,"Professor Khan was an OK teacher- not the best, nor the worst. He just seems full of himself, and spends way too much time promoting his Summer Abroad Program.

Also, attend class when there are guest lecturers!",2014-05-21 18:32:18
Michael Khan,RSM100,"Lectures are useless from a material standpoint, he needs to add irrelevant test questions based on the overly specific lecture material just to get people to attend.

Didn't attend any lectures second semester and still got an A",2013-11-20 12:57:21
Michael Khan,RSM100,He talks really fast and tests us more of his lecture than the textbook. Gosh...who will pay attention for almost full year course and remember everything from his talking?

Michael Khan,RSM100,Prof is very very boring and is pretty useless. Test is super hard. test is 50% textbook and 50% from lecture.

I think the course average is around 50% but oh well. rotman need to kick people out anyways,2013-04-18 00:00:48

Michael Khan,RSM100,He is an amiable man who enjoys his own classes ore than the students do. His efforts to make the class lively and entertaining often end in making the classes useless to the students as the material taught is negligible.

Michael Khan,RSML020,"For the most part, I enjoyed this class even though I had taken this already at CAPE. He is an approachable prof.

Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB204,"Dr P is overall pretty kind and knowledgeable and her tests are very fair and easy if you study. She tells you exactly what you need to know for her tests.

Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB204,"The pacing of her lectures is very inconsistent. This is due to the fact that she rambles a lot which complicates content further. The in-class question period runs on for too long. Her attitude during lecture is extremely palpable as she has no respect for the students, picking on minuscule things. This is an unwelcoming intro to Human Biology. ",2023-01-26 22:34:12
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB204,"Despite having taught this course for many years, I genuinely believed she was a first time professor due to how inexperienced her teaching seems.

Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,"If you went to class and actually listened, the prof made perfect sense.  You have to read the textbook too, but her notes were detailed enough.",2010-04-07 21:10:57
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,Worst prof I've ever had.  cannot teach.  Notes are not organized or concise. Pointless attending class.,2010-03-24 19:00:22
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,"If you went to class and read the slides over ahead of time, she made perfect sense.  You have to do the problems in the book though too.  I liked the fact that she tried to make the content interesting.",2010-03-23 19:32:30
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,I think that she made the material very clear-she was very helpful and available to answer questions.  She could be very funny too!,2010-03-23 19:26:45
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,not a great proff... read textbook,2010-03-10 03:22:07
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,"The most useless prof ever. Reads off slides, boring, and just awful.",2010-03-05 22:54:44
Maria Papaconstantinou,HMB265,"The most incompetent prof i have had in univ. She cannot teach...it is almost unbelievable that a world class institution will give her a teaching position. During lecture, she simply reads off her superficial, unclear slides, The best way to study is NOT to go to lecture, just read the text book, and do the assigned problems.",2010-02-23 00:18:45
James Hong,FINA4329,Professor Hong is awesome! He brought a lot of real world experience to the classroom and he made the lectures interesting! ,2022-05-09 13:30:47
James Hong,FINA4329,"He only uses slides for his lectures with bullet points. No textbook required. He also invites guest speakers to share experience and Q&A sections. Two exams non-comprehensive and one group project. Exams are straight forward from his slides. He takes attendance, either you attend online or in-person. Highly recommended for elective!!",2022-04-27 13:50:19
James Hong,FINA4329,This class is a really great elective to take! He gives you the material in a way that actually makes it interesting. He also has a way about him that just makes you want to pay attention to him. He brings in guest speakers that are really cool as well. You have two exams and one group project. 1000/10 recommend!!!,2021-12-01 03:30:22
James Hong,FINA4329,Professor Hong only uses lectures and guest speakers. He makes clear-cut ppts about his lectures which are only bullet points and he speaks about it and interacts with the class by asking questions and doesn't just read all through the class. Gives the perfect exam reviews!,2021-04-22 13:03:01
James Hong,FINA4329,Super easy A,2020-05-03 03:19:21
James Hong,FINA4329,Before Covid-19 his class made me get up for the 8am class and was not mad about it. He made the class worth it. Truly learned about insurance and wanted to learn more. No textbook since lectures cover the tests. No online PowerPoints just in class notes. PLEASE PLEASE TAKE THE CLASS. WORTH IT. I will definitely miss the class and professor.,2020-04-29 16:51:44
James Hong,FINA4329,"Professor Hong is another gem at Bauer. What a privilege I had to sit down in his class and learn about the importance of life insurance and risk management. No textbook required, as he just wants you to learn. The two exams are not hard, just show up and take notes. The group case study was a great learning experience. Thank you professor Hong!",2019-05-02 20:48:47
James Hong,FINA4329,I took his class at an 8 AM lecture. I was afraid I would fall asleep during lecture but his lectures never failed to keep me awake and entertained. He is a great teacher. Attendance is mandatory. Notes are given every class and are not posted so you must attend class to get the notes. He has one group project that he grades heavy.,2018-08-31 21:13:07
James Hong,FINA4397,"Professor Hong was great! I took this class an one of my easier finance electives. There are 2 tests with 50 m/c questions and a group project. Attendance is 10% of your grade and going makes the tests so much easier. Ppt slides are not posted online so you must be in class to get notes. As long as you have a good team, you'll ace this class.",2016-05-04 12:51:06
James Hong,4397,"GO TO CLASS!!! He hates giving tests but well, has to grade somehow. He makes the topic so interesting so I feel like I didn't even have to really study. Just studied 1-2 hrs prior to test and got an A in the class. But this is because I ATTENDED CLASS and was interested and participated in class. Group project. But I had an amazing group! No book.",2015-08-17 09:54:48
James Hong,4397,"The professor is a great man and very knowledgeable. I took him for Life Insurance and Annuities. Entering this class I didn't think I'd even have any interest in learning about life insurance but he changed that for me. He requires no textbook and take no attendance. Taking notes off of his slides will help you pass. It's a easy A+, I promise. ",2015-04-02 13:43:00

James Hong,FINA4397,"The beautiful world of life insurance did not seem enticing to me until this glorious man opened up my eyes to the beauty of whole life policies and annuities. Oh the knowledge he has bestowed on me will be heavily used throughout my lifetime. This treasure trove of information should be hollered to the masses! Yeah, just take the class.",2014-01-05 02:04:14
James Hong,FINA4397,"Absolutely great guy. Had him for life insurance and annuities. Super helpful and had LOTS of working knowledge of the industry. Really opened up my eyes to life insurance and annuities. Never expected for it to be so interesting but he made it a great class to attend every single time. Once again, GREAT teacher. Cant thank him enough.",2013-05-11 13:30:04
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"Great guy and fun lecturer. He teaches bio220 in a fun way and engaging way. His test questions are extremely fair and as long as you take notes on readings and take good notes on lectures, you will succeed.",2023-03-08 23:14:17
John Stinchcombe,BIO220ANDBIO120,"Great lecturer, seems like a really great guy. Unfortunately never got to meet him in person because I took both BIO120 and 220 asynchronous, but he structured his lectures really well and is super clear. Only downside was his tests felt a little unmanageable for the time given, with some ultra-specific reading questions sprinkled in. ",2023-03-04 23:42:18
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"Good guy. Really funny, cracks a lot of jokes in class. Very personable. I really liked his lecture style, gave many real life examples of topics and explained things in a very easy way. Very easy to talk to during office hours as well.",2023-02-28 21:03:29
John Stinchcombe,BIO220ANDBIO120,His in-person lectures were awesome! Always gave a clear explanation for different graphs and figures included in the slides. He would occasionally tell jokes and keep the class engaged. Loved going to his lectures! ,2023-02-20 04:06:06
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,Way better in person... Having him in BIO220.. he's hilarious and great at his job. Does not deserve the flack he sometimes gets. Worst part with him was his headset when he was online lol.,2023-02-18 22:58:10
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"His lectures were amazing! He explained the content well and made me genuinely interested in his subject. He was also very nice in his office hours! Most of the material is straightforward, but some extra studying is definitely needed to do well.",2022-01-10 18:06:31
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"He's a really good lecturer, and I always really liked going to his class. He explains things really thoroughly and is a funny guy. However, the midterm is absolutely pretty brutal. Make sure you do all the readings and watch any videos/movies he posts, as they WILL be tested on the midterm.",2021-10-20 23:58:33
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"He's a really good lecturer, amazing at communicating, and makes class super interesting. I thought his Ratemyprof score would be way higher bc he seems to understand how to give effective lectures. Idc much for ecology as a subject, but the BIO220 profs made it so interesting that it actually ended up becoming my favourite class of the year.",2021-05-29 23:33:00
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"He's a bit all over the place (might be the online format) and the relationship between the different topics he covers isn't always clear. He really hit his groove in the last few lectures about climate change & overpopulation though, and you can tell he really cares. Overall felt like the whole course (w/ Prof. Mideo) could use some restructuring.",2021-04-19 14:34:09
John Stinchcombe,BIO220H,"The lectures were easy to listen to and can be done at 1.5x the speed. He's a very clear communicator and clearly has a passion for biology as a whole. It is a lot of information to absorb and the final is worth 36% so hopefully, it goes well. His dog, Charli, was a cute pop-up throughout the semester!",2021-04-14 03:08:32
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"Prof Stinchcombe was nice, nothing out of the ordinary but his lectures were good and I felt like I learned a bunch. Tests weren't too hard and the labs were interesting, difficult online but that's not anyone's fault.",2021-03-04 19:30:50
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"Others don't like his lectures, but I found them to be interesting while also detailed. His tests are difficult, especially ones about the book ""Why Evolution is True"" (e.g. asking a question about a specific example in the book that is only mentioned once), but if you study hard they aren't impossible to do well in.",2021-01-14 19:22:15
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,Some people felt his lectures were dry but I honestly enjoyed them. He was clear about his expectations and his tests reflected lectures quite well.,2020-12-18 18:49:57
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"Not super dynamic. Lectures are pretty rambly and confusingly organized, jumping back and forth between topics even in the slides (often had to restructure my notes afterwards to make things clearer). Exams feel short for the amount of Qs; some Qs ask to extrapolate on course concepts and apply them to hypothetical/non-covered material.",2020-12-09 17:42:33
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"Too bad. Overall bad. His lecture is just useless. After all, he just read his ppt. The more he explained a concept, the more confused it gets. Just don't listen to his confusing filibuster and you have a chance to survive his nonsence-tests. By the way he never test things he belaboured in his useless filibuster.",2020-12-09 05:39:10
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,He lectured the first 1/2 of the course for evolutionary biology. This course has made me seriously consider choosing that POSt. He lectures at a good pace and gives pretty good explanations whenever students want clarification.,2020-11-10 17:09:52
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,pretty good overall. very funny in lectures and very passionate. there wasnt textbook reading but we did have to read a novel which was kinda odd for a biology class. tests were a little tricky but not too bad. wish they gave us some type of practice problems to be better prepared for the test. i enjoyed the course more than i thought i would.,2020-10-26 21:45:09
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,Professor Stinchcombe is a great lecturer. He is very engaging and enthusiastic. He makes lectures interesting and made me actually enjoy evolutionary biology. His tests are very memorization heavy and are somewhat difficult .,2020-03-18 03:07:17
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"Here is the thing. The professor is nice during the lecture. All the explanations are clear, the style is funny. However, the midterm is really designed to get your mark down. He even tells you to memorize things from a video, which is absolutely unrelated to ecology in any extent.",2020-03-03 17:16:29
John Stinchcombe,BIO220ANDBIO120,This course was not one of the best. The material would seem interesting to only those who are interested in EEB. I hated the midterm it was all analyzing and graphs. Pay attention in his class.,2020-03-03 00:43:40
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"Professor Stinchcombe was funny and concise. The tests were fair and very easy as long as you read the material, any confusing questions on the test will be given as bonus marks after the tests are marked. The class was interesting and designed in a way that makes it possible to get incredibly high marks. An awesome professor and course.",2020-02-02 08:09:25
John Stinchcombe,BIO120,"He literally just reads straight off the slides, no point in going to lectures. His wording for tests are really confusing. Goodluck!",2020-01-17 03:20:43
John Stinchcombe,BIO150,"Ok so basically Stinchcombe is a really good professor because everything u need to know is on the slides and he just repeats it lol. His tests are mod. You have to remember that one example he said in lecture 7, slide 11 (ex) and like the specifics. Very heavy memorization. -This is BIO120 btw idk about other courses he may teach.",2019-12-18 07:27:54
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,Pretty funny prof that tries to make lecture relatable and interesting. Test questions were as expected. Some questions relate directly back to readings but he tells you that before the test.,2018-02-27 21:16:45
John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"Love him!! I'm going to miss him in the second section of the course. Really funny and likeable, and really makes you care about what we're doing to the planet (this course gets pretty depressing towards the end of his section). I look forward to taking more of his courses.",2018-02-14 19:06:03
John Stinchcombe,EEB318,"SO many of his exam questions are worded difficultly. For example, his questions ask ""which of the following is most likely to be proven false"". He's also a big fan of the questions where he lists 5 statements and then has you choose which ones are true or false or can be proven with a complementary graph.",2018-01-16 12:10:11

John Stinchcombe,BIO220,"He was okay. Pretty mediocre, especially compared to Rowe. Some of the exam questions made no sense and there were no practice exams, which are useful for predicting a prof's style of questioning.",2014-04-23 16:57:46

John Stinchcombe,BIO220H,Lectures were alright (explained well & material was interesting). Test questions were also very straightforward: either thinking questions asking you to analyze data/predict based on data OR simple knowledge questions. Very good prof.,2013-05-01 15:44:43
John Stinchcombe,BIO324,"I took this course a few years ago. I had had this prof as an instructor on a field course and his enthusiasm for Ecology & Evolution was the impetus that pushed me to this stream of biology. He is very personable, quite approachable (when you get to know him) and is good at explaining concepts. He's clear about expectations, and expects a lot.",2012-07-24 23:57:41

John Stinchcombe,BIO150,"Maybe his voice will sound better when he hits puberty.  Painful to listen to on the recordings.  Also, barely suppressed his rage when somebody blocked the projector.  He needs to be put on a shelf until he matures.",2009-02-18 17:30:23

Nicole Mideo,BIO22O,"She did a really good job with adapting the class for online learning. Slides were well made, lectures were clear, test questions on her material were fair.

Nicole Mideo,BIO220,"She obviously loves her topic but I don't think she explains concepts as clearly as she could / as well as she understands them herself.

Nicole Mideo,BIO220,Super engaging. I already knew most of the material and could have tuned her out but shes really fun to listen to. Also a nice person to talk to and ask for clarification.
